In January of 1809, an agitated and anxious Napoleon hurried back toParis from his Spanish wars. His spies and confidants had confirmed arumor that his foreign minister Talleyrand had conspired against him withFouché, the minister of police. Immediately on arriving in the capital theshocked emperor summoned his ministers to the palace. Following theminto the meeting right after their arrival, he began pacing up and down,and started rambling vaguely about plotters working against him, speculators bringing down the stock market, legislators delaying his policies—a.ndhis own ministers undermining him.As Napoleon talked, Talleyrand leaned on the mantelpiece, lookingcompletely indifferent. Facing Talleyrand directly, Napoleon announced,"For these ministers, treason has begun when they permit themselves todoubt." At the word "treason" the ruler expected his minister to be afraid.But Talleyrand only smiled, calm and bored.
