survival of any early human is to belong to a group. If your clan boots youout, it wonâ€™t be long before the wolves find you. So how does the mind protect you from rejectionby the group? By comparing you with other members of the clan: Am I fitting in? Am I doing theright thing? Am I contributing enough? Am I as good as the others? Am I doing anything that mightget me rejected?Sound familiar? Our modern-day minds are continually warning us of rejection and comparing usagainst the rest of society.
