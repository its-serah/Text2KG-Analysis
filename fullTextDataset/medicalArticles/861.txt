Carcinoma of the external and middle ear is a very rare disease. Despite the various treatment modalities available, its prognosis is still poor. We aimed to analyze the treatment modalities, outcomes, and validity of surgical approaches, especially in advanced tumors in the ear. Twenty-five patients with carcinoma of the external and middle ear were retrospectively analyzed. The modified Pittsburgh staging system was used for staging of the patients. Overall and disease-free survival was estimated using of Kaplan-Meier method. In our cohort of 25 patients, the majority (76%) had tumor located in external auditory meatus. The most common histologic subtype was squamous cell carcinoma (80%). More than half of patients (56%) had tumor stage IV.Â
