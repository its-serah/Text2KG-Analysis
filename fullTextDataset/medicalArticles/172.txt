 a model of the mother-baby interaction is proposed to explicatethe dynamics of the "wrong kind of mothering" and itsconsequences: my proposition is that the mutual exchanges betweenmother and baby consist in a give and take of action andreaction between the two partners, which requires from eachof them both active and passive responses.  these responses formseries and chains, the single links of which consist in what i call"action cycles," each completed in itself and at the same timeanticipating the next link. i designated these seriated responseexchanges as the "precursor of dialogue," as a primal dialogue.the dialogue acts as a vector of the baby's development,influencing its direction and stimulating it to adaptive efforts andpsychic growth.
