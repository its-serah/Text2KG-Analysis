ventriculo-venous shunts for infantile hydrocephalusa review of 48 hydrocephalic patientstreated with atrioventricular shunts during a5-year period has been presented.  we havediscussed function of the shunt, complica-tions of the procedure, and revisions neces-sitated by nonfunctioning.  the overall 75per cent survival rate and 14.3 per cent in-fection rate is comparable to that in otherseries.  the major cause of death in our pa-tients has been infection.our experience to date supports the ob-servation that spontaneous arrest of the hy-drocephalic process does not occur once aventriculo-venous shunt has been estab-lished.
