This report presents ultrastructural observations on the cytological events that attendmyelin formation occurring in the wake of demyelination in adult cat spinal cord. Lesions were induced in subpial cord by cerebrospinal fluid (c.s.f.) exchange (1, 2). Tissuefrom eleven cats at nine intervals from 19 to 460 days was fixed in situ by replacing c.s.f.with buffered OsO4 and embedded in Araldite. After demyelination, axons are embracedby sheet-like glial processes. An occasional myelin sheath is first seen at 19 days; by 64days, all axons are at least thinly myelinated. The cytoplasm of the myelin-forming cells,unlike that of either oligodendrocyte or fibrous astrocyte in normal cord, is dense withclosely packed organelles and fine fibrils. Many of the myelinogenic cells become scarringastrocytes and at 460 days the lesion teems with their fibril-filled processes. Oligodendrocytes appear in the lesion after remyelination is under way. Phagocytes disappear gradually.
