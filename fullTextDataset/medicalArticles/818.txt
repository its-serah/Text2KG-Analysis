3831. lysosomes in the rat sciatic nerve following crushperipheral nerves undergoing degenerationare favorable material for studying thetypes, origins, and functions of lysosomes.the following lysosomes are described(a) autophagic vacuoles in altered schwanncells.  within these vacuoles the myelinand much of the axoplasm which it enclosesin the normal nerve are degraded (wal-lerian degeneration).  the delimitingmembranes of the vacuoles apparently formfrom myelin lamellae.  considered aspossible sources of their acid phosphatase aregolgi vesicles (primary lysosomes), lysosomesof the dense body type, and the endo-plasmic reticulum which lies close to the vacuoles.(b) mebranous bodies that accu-mulate focally in myelinated fibers in a zone extending2 to 3 mm distal to the crush.these appear to arise from the endoplasmic reticulum
