1845. further studies on specific transplantation antigens in rous sarcoma ofmicemice allografted with different sarcomas, induced by the schmidt-ruppin variantof rous sarcoma virus (rsv-sr), showed a resistance against subsequentisografting of 9 different rous sarcomas.  transplantationresistance could also be induced byrous mouse tumor cells x-irradiated with 8000 ror with cell-free tumor extracts,containing no demonstrable virus.  notransplantation resistance could be demon-strated after allograft pretreatment withvarious polyoma tumors or non-viral tu-mors.
