(3) cardiac output and stroke volume decreased by standing in most of the cases . recent data were added to those reported previously and weretreated statistically . average decrease in cardiac output was -13 in 6 control cases, -35 in 16 cases with neurocirculatory asthenia and -35 in10 cases with hyperthyroidism . the difference was significant between  control and neurocirculatory asthenia . standing induced a substantial  increase in cardiac output in a case of idiopathic nodal rhythm,        although there remains a doubt whether it is the ordinary response in   this disease .
