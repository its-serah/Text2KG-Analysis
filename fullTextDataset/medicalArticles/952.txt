2725. demonstration of myocardial infarction by photoscans ofthe heart in manintravenously injected radioiodinated oleic acidwas incorporated into heart musclein sufficient concentration to permit recording photoscansof the heart in man.  in3 fatal cases of massive septal myocardial infarction,injection of the radioiodin-ated fatty acid (rifa) was made during life; at necropsyphotoscans of the excisedheart showed a discrete area of absent radioactivitycorresponding to the infarctedinterventricular septum.  photoscans of the heart weremade during life in 42 pa-tients, 9 of whom had suffered recent myocardial infarction.there were definiteareas of deceased radioactivity corresponding to the locationof the infarction,
