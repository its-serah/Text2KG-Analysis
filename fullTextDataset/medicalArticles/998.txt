hela cells resistant to bromodeoxyuridine and deficient in thymidinekinase activity.mutant sublines of hela s3 cells resistantto growth inhibition by bromodeoxyuridine(budr) have been isolated.  the resistantcell lines (hela bu-10, hela bu-15,hela bu-25, hela bu-50, and hela bu-100)proliferated in the presence of 10,15,25,50, and 100 mg/ml budr, respectively.extracts from hela bu-25, helabu-50, and hela bu-100 cells exhibited2-5% of the thymidine-h, deoxyuridine-h,and bromodeoxyuridine-h phosphorylatingactivities of parental hela s3 cells.hela bu-10 and hela bu-15 cell extractswere also deficient in thymidine kinaseactivity, yielding approx.
