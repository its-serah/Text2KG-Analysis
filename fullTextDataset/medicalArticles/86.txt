the ultrastructure, histopathology, andhistochemistry of the parathyroid glands of pregnantand nonpregnant cows fed a high level of vitamin d.the parathyroid glands of pregnant andnonpregnant cows were studied by light andelectron microscopy following the dailyfeeding of 30 million units of vit d for 30days and compared to untreated controls.in both the pregnant and nonpregnant cowsthe parathyroid glands became markedlyatrophic with a diminution in the amount ofparenchyma compared to the untreated controls.after vit d feeding the number ofactively secreting dark and intermediatechief cells was reduced and the percentageof inactive (light) and atrophic chief cellswas increased.Â
