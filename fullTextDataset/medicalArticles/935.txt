3748. four separate tumour clones derived from a transplantable pleo-morphic carcinoma of the lung in a heterozygous mousea metastasising pleomorphic adenocarcinomain the lung of an untreated hetero-zygous male mouse was successfullytransplanted to 4 brothers by the 'plating'technique of henderson and rous.  by'plating' multiple small grafts in air bells inthe subcutaneous tissues of the new hostsit was possible to select 4 different clonesof transplantable tumour for further study.the histological peculiarities ofdifferent parts of the original tumourwere reproduced in the different clones a i,ii, iii, and b.  retrospective studyof the primary tumour and of its metastasesprovided some interesting clues to routesof metastasis and the selective survival ofmalignant cells.
