the factthat insulin exerts effects on protein metabolism at otherintracellular sites as well as the above independent effectsleads one to agree that its action consists of a stimulationof multiple, seemingly unrelated, metabolic events. the fact that an immediate effect of insulin on proteinsynthesis is independent of the immediate need for extracellularglucose or amino acids does not mean that thesustained functioning of cells is likewise independent.  thebiochemist is fully aware of metabolic defects in diabeteswhich are not altered by insulin in vitro, but which demandvarying periods of pretreatment of the animal.  it isalso known that in diabetes some proteins (enzymes) maybe deficient while others may be produced in excess in theabsence of insulin.it is suggested that the physician desires at least twokinds of relation between these fundamental studies and his patients.
