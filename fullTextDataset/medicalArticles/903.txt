chromosomal patterns in cancer patients during treatment .                radiation damages the chromosomes of human cells, and through         short-term cultures of white blood cells some of this damage can be     assessed . patients with cancer were selected for this study because of the large portions of the blood-forming tissues irradiated in the courseof treatment . chromosomal damage may be quantitative with variations   from the normal number of 46, or qualitative, thereby showing structuralaberrations . counting the chromosomes in cells from cultures grown     prior to therapy and at intervals during treatment enables us to        determine the variation .
