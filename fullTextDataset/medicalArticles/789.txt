ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation clinical, hemodynamicand surgical considerations .                                             the clinical, hemodynamic, angiographic and anatomic findings in      fifteen patients with ventricular septal defect complicated by aortic   regurgitation are presented . in this combination of malformations the  aortic regurgitation is acquired and results from prolapse of an aortic valve leaflet into the septal defect . the strategic location of the    septal defect in relation to the aortic leaflets appears to be more     important to the development of this complication than the size of the  defect or the magnitude of the shunt through it . the onset of aortic   regurgitation occurs during early childhood and, once present, tends to become more severe .
