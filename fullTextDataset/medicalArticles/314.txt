the aetiology and treatment ofurinary calculusinvestigations in this laboratory have beenbased on the hypothesis that calculus formation isprimarily a process of crystallization from super-saturated solutions rather than one of adsorptionon a specific protein matrix, as has been postulatedby boyce and his colleagues (boyce and king,1963).  that crystallization is the primary factoris strongly suggested by the recent studies ofvermeulen, lyon and gill (1964).  these authorsproduced artificial concretions which closelyresembled urinary calculi by immersing a rotatingwire loop in normal urine for several days andslowly adding the appropriate stone-formingelements.
