experiments dealing with the role played by the aqueous humor and retinain lens regeneration of adult newts .                                     1. these three groups of experiments involve approximately 140 eyes ofadult newts, triturus v. viridescens . they were devised to examine     what, if any, role the aqueous humor plays during lens regeneration fromthe dorsal iris .                                                         2. many daily injections of aqueous humor from normal eyes were made  in lentectomized eyes for as long as 96 days in some cases . as controlssome lensless eyes were daily injected with holtfreter's solution . in  others aqueous humor was merely withdrawn .                               3) procedures for the injection experiments are difficult to control .however, the most successful cases showed varying degrees of inhibition and retardation of lens regeneration .
