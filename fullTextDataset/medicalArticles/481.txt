  4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to the    total daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remainsfairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein being      excreted .                                                                5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance between   the degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of the       disease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance .              6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initial blood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type of     protein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and had        initially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity type or better .
