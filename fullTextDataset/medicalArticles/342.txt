Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was employed for the protein analysis of several different mouse tissues and Drosophila. The number of protein spots detected with conventional protein dye staining techniques ranged from 110 in erythrocyte lysate to 320 in liver homogenate. Strain variation of protein spots on the gels was examined in five different tissues from two strains of inbred mice (DBA/2J and C57BL/6J) and their F1 hybrids. The protein spots which exhibited strain variation were shown to be autosomally inherited and to follow Mendelian genetics. From these analyses, it was shown that the frequencies of protein variations between these two strains of mice vary from 1 to 5% with the tissue examined.
