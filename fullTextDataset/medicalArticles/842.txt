2431. the natural history of arrhythmias following septal defect reapirthe repair of 191 atrial and ventricular septaldefects between 1955 and 1961 wasreviewed to determine the incidence and prognosisof arrhythmias related to operation.cases included 90 ventricular septal defects, 61atrial defects of the ostium secundumtype, and 40 of the ostium primum variety.nodal rhythms, second degree blocks,complete heart block, and flutter or fibrillation thatpersisted after completion of operationwere analyzed, while intermittent ectopic beats,sinus tachycardia, and bundle branchblocks were excluded.  fifteen per cent of thepatients with ventricular defects, 17%with ostium primum defects, and 35% with ostiumsecundum defects developed abnormalrhythms associated with repair.  of 18 patients whosearrhythmias began during operation,there were 8 deaths;
