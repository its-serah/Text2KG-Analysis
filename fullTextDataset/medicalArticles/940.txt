The field of foreign language teaching of deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals has only recently been receiving systematic attention from practitioners and researchers. Evidence that could serve as a well-founded basis for practice is lacking, and this has repeatedly been mentioned as an issue in the field. The objective of this chapter is to discuss the notion that no practice, even if well-evidenced and successful in a particular case, can serve as a universal recipe for all deaf learners. Deaf learners do not represent a homogeneous group; their learning preferences are influenced by their linguistic and educational histories, family backgrounds, and existing attitudes and abilities, as well as by their character traits and personal interests. The text is based on practical experiences with teaching particular deaf learners in addition to research conducted by the author.
