747. electrode size and tissue po2 measurement in rats exposedto air or high pressure oxygena comparison has been made of values ofpo2 recorded in several rat tissues with60-u or 330-u flexible gold electrodes.although qualitatively both sizes of elec-trodes give similar results, the quantitativevalues of po2 differ.  such large differ-ences as are found in some cases betweenelectrodes varying only in physical di-mensions are thought to reflect the amountof trauma caused in the tissue under in-vestigation due to electrode insertion.errors in po2 estimations due to tissue da-mage are considered to outweigh any othererrors such as those due to electrodecalibration.
