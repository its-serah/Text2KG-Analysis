1361. the mechanism of histidase induction and formation in bacillus subtilisthe role of the inducer, l-histidine, in thesynthesis of histidase (l-histidine am-monia lyase) in b. subtilis was investigated.it was found that induced cells poisonedwith actinomycin, an inhibitor of rna synthesis,lose their capacity for the forma-tion of a protein precursor of histidase at a ratewhich is independent of the presenceor absence of the inducer.  these results showthat the inducer does not increasethe intracellular level of histidase-specificmessenger rna by preventing the des-truction of the major portion of this material,the fraction that is engaged in pro-tein synthesis.
