1991. ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation.medical and pathologic aspectsthirty-four patients with ventricular septal defectand aortic regurgitation, repre-senting less than 5% of the patients with ventricularseptal defect, are discussed.a loud, systolic murmur, characteristic of ventricularseptal defect, is noted dur-ing infancy, whereas evidences of aortic regurgitation(protodiastolic murmur andwide pulse pressure) does not usually appear until sometime between 2 and 10years of age.  clinical and catheterization data indicatethat the principal hemody-namic load is aortic regurgitation, whereas theventricular septal defect does notusually result in a large pulmonary blood flow orhigh pulmonary arterial pressure.in about 50% of the patients, a significant pressuregradient across the right ven-tricular outflow tract exists.
