psychological effects of circumcision .                                   in order to evaluate the psychological effects of circumcision, a     small study was arranged in which twelve children, from average and low socio-economic level, were given goodenough dam test, cat, rorschach andtwo sets of stories, prior to the operation and following it . the      results of the tests showed that circumcision, performed around the     phallic stage is perceived by the child as an act of aggression and     castration . it has detrimental effects on the child's functioning and  adaptation, particularly on his ego strength . by weakening the         controlling and defensive mechanisms of the ego, and initiating         regression, it loosens the previously hidden fears, anxieties, and      instinctual impulses, and renders a feeling of reality to them . what isexpressed following the operation is primitive, archaic, and            unsocialized in character .
