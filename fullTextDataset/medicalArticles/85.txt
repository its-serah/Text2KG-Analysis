502. the haemodynamic implications of the bisferiens pulsea bisferiens carotid arterial displacement pulsewas recorded in 10 patients withsevere aortic valvular disease.  the braunwaldtest indicated that moderately severe,severe, or gross aortic regurgitation was presentin each.  the absence of a peaksystolic aortic pressure gradient in certain cases,particularly in those with themost severe regurgitation, suggested their freedomfrom an element of stenosis.the anacrotic wave and the peak of the aorticpressure pulse were found to coincidewith the percussion and the tidal waves of thesimultaneously recorded carotid ar-terial displacement curves.
