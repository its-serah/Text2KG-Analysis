198. early experiences with azathioprine in ulcerative colitis.  a note ofcautionazathioprine was administered to 10 patients with ulcerative colitis classifiedas 'very severe' in 2,'moderately severe' in 7 and 'relatively mild' in 1patient, in conjunction with 'standard' therapy and adrenal corticosteroids in8 of the 10 patients.  the possible beneficial therapeutic effects ofazathioprine in this small series cannot be evaluated definitively because ofthe concurrent medication and the preliminary uncontrolled observations.however, clinical improvement was apparent in 8 of the 10 patients; and in 2patients, the favorable course occurred in the absence of steroid therapy.  in2 additional patients, the favorable course was maintained during theadministration of azathioprine following the discontinuance of prolongedsteroid therapy.
