the study of osteoporosisand osteomalaciaradiological evidence strongly suggests thatosteoporosis (with the possible exception of acuteimmobilization osteoporosis) may be an irrever-sible condition.  the changes therefore to beexpected in calcium balance when an osteoporoticis treated are small compared with those oftenseen in osteomalacia.  methods of obtaining moreaccurate calcium balances are needed to showthese small changes, especially when a highcalcium intake is used.  the method of continuousmarking of stools with chromium sesquioxideseems to provide just such a method.
