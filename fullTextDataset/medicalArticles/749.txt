influence of hormones on tumor growth and plasma prolactin levels in ratsbearing a pituitary "mammotropic" tumorthe effects of estradiol, cortisol acetate, thyroxine, or thiouracil ontumor growth, organ weights, and plasma prolactin levels were determinedin rats bearing a furth pituitary "mammotropic" tumor (mtt.f4).  thistumor is known to secrete large amounts of adrenocorticotropin, somatotropin,and prolactin, but no follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone,or thyrotropin.  at the dose levels used, estradiol significantly suppressedtumor growth without influencing body growth, and it partially inhibitedenlargement of the adrenals and atrophy of the thymus.  cortisol acetatesignificantly reduced both tumor and body growth.
