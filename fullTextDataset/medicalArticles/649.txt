Hydrocephalus is a clinical and neuroradiographic diagnosis characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid which can occur in conjunction with, or in absence of, changes to intracranial pressure. In the latter cases, it is thought that pressure remains normal or low because compensation is occurring elsewhere: either at the expense of the cortical tissue or by the expansion of the skull, or in rare cases, both [4]. The normal flow of CSF is from lateral ventricles through the foramen of Monroe, into the common third ventricle proceeding into the fourth ventricle through the cerebral aqueduct and out of the foramen of Luschka and Magendie into the subarachnoid space.Â
