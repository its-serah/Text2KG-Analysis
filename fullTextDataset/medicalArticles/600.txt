the effects of electrophoretically separated lens proteins on lens      regeneration in diemyctylus viridescens .                                 in the present study, lenses were removed from the eyes of adult      anesthetized newts, macerated in 0.03 m borate buffer at ph 8.6, and    separated by starch gel electrophoresis . upon staining with amido black10-b, seven distinct staining areas appeared in the blocks . three bandsmoved toward the anode, and three toward the cathode . in addition, a   seventh moiety represented by a smear of material moved toward the anodeone millimeter times five tenths millimeter plugs were removed from   each of these areas and were placed into freshly lentectomized eyes .   plugs from most strongly positive and most weakly negative proteins     inhibited lens regeneration . in addition, plugs from the area          containing the weakly negative protein induced either lenses with       aberrant polarity or double centered lenses with centers of opposed     polarity . all other protein bands had no significant effect on         regeneration .
