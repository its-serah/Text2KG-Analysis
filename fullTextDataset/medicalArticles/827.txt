         hypertrophy, degeneration and desquamation of the   alveolar lining and proliferation of alveolar macrophages resulted in   complete consolidation, which was progressive up to 1 week after        infection .                                                               the central areas of the lung were affected somewhat differently . at 3 days after infection, the nonciliated bronchiolar cells showed        considerable hyperplasia of endoplasmic reticulum and apical cytoplasmicedema . viral particles matured at the lumen surface of these cells and were then released into the bronchiolar lumen . the bronchiolar cells,  both ciliated and nonciliated, underwent degeneration and sloughed into the bronchiolar lumen . the regenerating epithelium was stratified, and the surface cells were elongated and flattened . the peribronchiolar    interstitial tissue gradually became totally infiltrated by cells,      mostly of the mononuclear type .
