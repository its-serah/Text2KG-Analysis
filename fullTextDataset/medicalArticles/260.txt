7083. brain damage and paralysis in animals exposed to high pressure oxygen -pharmacological and biochemical observationssingle exposures of high pressure oxygen(ohp) at 30-66  gauge pressure causedcns damage and paralysis in rats and micebut guinea-pigs, rabbits, and man didnot show such sequelae.  the cns damagein rats was greatly increased by cns-de-pressant drugs (pentobarbital, paraldehyde,n2o and phencyclidine) given before ex-posure to ohp.  the cns lesions were alsopotentiated by raised respired pco2, byacetazolamide and by nh4c1, whilst protectionwas afforded by methaemoglobinae-mia by tham, by 2 4-dinitrophenol and byserotonin against the barbiturate andco2 potentiation of ohp brain damage.
