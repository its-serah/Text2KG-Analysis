The etiology of craniolacunia is unclear with varied school of thoughts. Fetuses with this rare condition may have associated neural tube defects (NTDs) and hydrocephalus, which may require neurosurgical interventions. Craniolacunia may be self‐limiting without NTDs. This case report emphasizes the importance of three‐dimensional CT scan in diagnosing Craniolacunia.
Craniosynostosis results from the fusion of one or more of the cranial sutures prematurely. This can be an isolated defect or as part of a syndrome. 1 , 2  The etiology of most single‐suture synostosis is thought to be idiopathic, even though defective dural‐mesenchymal signaling issues and genetic causes are increasingly being identified.
