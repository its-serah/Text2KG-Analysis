Coronary vasospasm remains the most well-established manifestation of fluoropyrimidine cardiotoxicity, as supported by in vitro models of concentration-dependent vasoconstriction by 5-FU on vascular smooth muscle cells.5 However, some patients with reduced ejection fraction by echocardiography have been reported to demonstrate left ventricular wall motion abnormalities in areas that do not correspond to a classic coronary vessel distribution, suggesting that the mechanisms of cardiotoxicity may be multifactorial.6 Direct toxicity to the myocardium has been proposed to be mediated by cardiotoxic metabolites such as fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate.7 Direct toxicity to the coronary endothelial intima may contribute to thrombosis.8 In vivo studies in rabbits have demonstrated apoptosis of epicardial cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells of the distal coronary arteries as a consequence of 5-FU treatment, leading to inflammation as seen in myocarditis.9 An in vitro study demonstrated increased reactive oxygen species in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells in the setting of 5-FU exposure.
