renal amyloidosis a clinicopathological study .                           the clinical and histopathological data from 40 cases of renal        amyloidosis diagnosed by percutaneous renal biopsy are presented .        twenty-two cases were labelled as 'secondary' amyloidosis, as definiteaetiological factors responsible for renal amyloidosis could be         discovered . the predisposing disease states leading to amyloid depositsin the kidney in the order of frequency were fibrocaseous pulmonary     tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and ileocaecal tuberculosis five cases were labelled as suspected 'primary' amyloidosis as a      definite evidence of the predisposing disease could not be obtained     although the skiagram of chest revealed minimal healed foci . no cause  could be determined in thirteen cases, which were, therefore, labelled  as 'primary' amyloidosis .
