 the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of ribonucleic     acids from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung was 48 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 34 to 64 . the mean      concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of rna from ultracentrifugal  supernatants of homogenates of rat liver was 29 ug. of ni per gm. of    rna, with a range from 21 to 39 .                                         measurements of nickel were performed upon fractions of human serum   proteins, prepared by continuous-flow electrophoresis, and by           cold-ethanol precipitation . the highest concentrations of nickel were  found in preparations of serum b-globulins .
