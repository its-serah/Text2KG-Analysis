studies on compensatory renal hypertrophy.  i.  effect ofunilateral ureteral ligation and transectiondata are presented comparing the relative rateof compensatory renal hypertrophyand hyperplasia of the control kidney of ratsfollowing either unilateral ureteraltransection, ligation, or nephrectomy.  the growthof the control kidney on the unoperatedside was strikingly slower after ureteraltransection and ligation whencompared with that resulting from the removalof one kidney.  progressive hydronephrosiswas observed on the operated side followingureteral transection andligation and was more pronounced in the latter.
