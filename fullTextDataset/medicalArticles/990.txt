A colorimetric assay method and stabilized working reagents for the determination of magnesium in which an alkaline reagent containing a dye to complex magnesium reacts directly with the sample, requiring no protein-removal steps and no addition of substances to artificially correct for absorption differences of the metallized and free dye due to the presence of protein. The dye is either Calmagite or Eriochrome Black T. The reagent is buffered so that the pH is greater than about 9.0; the relative Van Slyke buffer value Î²' of the reagent is greater than 1.
