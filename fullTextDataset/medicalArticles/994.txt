Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (CPAN) is a localized cutaneous vascular disorder characterized by necrotizing arteritis of medium-sized vessels in the skin. We report two cases of CPAN associated with seronegative arthritis resulting in chronic pain and disability. Arthralgia has previously been reported in CPAN, but an association with arthritis has not been emphasized.
Case 1 was a 50-yr-old male who presented in November 1993 with a 4-yr history of recurrent tender erythematous papules, and an 8-yr history of arthralgia affecting his right ankle. Examination revealed a patchy violaceous eruption around his right ankle, papules on his foot, two ulcers over the lateral malleolus and bilateral pitting ankle oedema. Marked limitation of movement was noted at the ankle and subtalar joints.
