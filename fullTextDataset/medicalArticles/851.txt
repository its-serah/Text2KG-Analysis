To further examine the half-life of alveolar macrophages, chimericCD 45.2 mice were generated through bonemarrow transplantationof donor CD 45.1 cells. Before administration of donor cells, recipientmice were divided into two cohorts: the first cohort received totalbody irradiation; the second cohort also received irradiation—however, the thorax, head, and upper extremities were shieldedwith lead. Flow cytometric analysis was then performed on blood,peritoneal, and bronchoalveolar lavage cells over time to quantifyengraftment.
