 there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge by        accretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolar     space . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater number    late in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when the     cuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattened type . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .                          on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusion      bodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it is     concluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active during  remodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .                        the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonary      surfactant is discussed .
