3105. studies on the subunits of a-crystallin and their recombi-nationearlier investigations have shown that, inthe presence of high concentrations ofurea, a-crystallin from bovine lens is splitinto a number of subunits with apparent-ly different electrophoretic mobilities butsimilar molecular weights.  the recom-bination of these subunits after removal ofthe urea has been studied by ultracentri-fugation and immunoprecipitation techniques.it was found that maximal recombina-tion was obtained when the ionic strengthduring the removal of the urea was high(>0.2), whereas at low ionic strengths amolecule with only half the molecular weightof native a-crystallin and a much lowersedimentation coefficient was obtained.
