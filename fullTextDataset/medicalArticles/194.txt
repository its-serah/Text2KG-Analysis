Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that exhibits significant clinical heterogeneity. There are various treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, including disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and inflammatory cytokine inhibitors (ICI), typically associated with differentiated clinical effects and characteristics. Personalized responsiveness is observed to the standard treatment due to the pathophysiological heterogeneity in rheumatoid arthritis, resulting in an overall poor prognosis. Understanding the role of individual variation in cellular and molecular mechanisms related to rheumatoid arthritis will considerably improve clinical care and patient outcomes. In this review, we discuss the source of pathophysiological heterogeneity derived from genetic, molecular, and cellular heterogeneity and their possible impact on precision medicine and personalized treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.Â
