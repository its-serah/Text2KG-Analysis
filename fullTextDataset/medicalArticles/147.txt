serum chorionic 'growth hormone-prolactin' and serum pituitarygrowth hormone in mother and fetus at term.chorionic 'growth hormone-prolactin' (cgp) andpituitary hgh were measured inmaternal and fetal blood obtained simultaneouslyat term from 29 pregnant womenand their fetuses utilizing sensitive radioimmunoassayprocedures.  the mean concentrationof serum cgp in maternal venous bloodwas 5.6  g/ml (sem0.39) whereasin umbilical venous serum the mean concentrationwas 0.019  g/ml (sem 0.003),a 300-fold difference.  contrariwise, the meanconcentration of serum hgh in maternalserum was 5.9 m g/ml (sem 0.52) andin umbilical venous serum the levelwas 33.5 m g/ml (sem 4.6).  the ratio of serumcgp/hgh in maternal venous serumwas 1076 in contrast to 0.57 in umbilical venousserum.  the findings strongly suggestthat cgp is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblastalmost exclusively in a unidirectionalmanner into the maternal circulation.
