the regulation of growth hormone secretionin the present communication we summarizeour investigations on the controlof secretion of hgh using radioimmunoassayfor the measurement of plasmagh. the assumption, implied throughout thispresentation, that changes insecretory rate are responsible for acutechanges in plasma concentration ofhgh appears reasonable since thefluctuations in plasma hgh concentrationare often too rapid to be caused solely byalterations in hormonaldegradation or excretion.  for slower changesin plasma hgh concentration,however, alterations in the rate of removalof hormone from the body fluidsmight play a contributory role.
