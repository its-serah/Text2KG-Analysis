1747. the problem of albuminoidalbuminoid is the main constituent of theinsoluble fraction of the lens proteins.albuminoid from the cortex of ox lens hasbeen fractionated on deae-cellulose in7 m urea; peptide maps of the fractionsare very similar to those from the corre-sponding fractions from a-crystallin.albuminoid can be regarded as an insolublea-crystallin.  an undiluted ground lensis clear but becomes turbid on dilution.  ifalbuminoid is present in the normal lens,it does not cause turbidity even when thecellular structure is disrupted.
