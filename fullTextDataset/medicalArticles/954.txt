abscopal effects of whole-bodyx-irradiation on compensatory hypertrophyof the rat kidney.the weight and dna content of normal growing (i.e., intact), andhypertrophying (i.e., following uninephrectomy) rat kidneys wereobtained from several hundred sprague-dawley white rats.  theeffect of whole body x irradiation with 500 rad and local irradiationto the kidney with 1000 rad, was then determined by following therate and degree of hypertrophy and the dna content of the kidney.when calculated on the basis of body surface area, a constant ratioof kidney weight and of kidney dna was found in the normal, non-hypertrophying kidneys of 5-12 week old rats.  after 21 days ofhypertrophy these values increased approximately 50 per cent overnormal in rats 4-6 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy.
