current status of hypothermia .                                           moderate hypothermia has been recommended for many and varied         conditions . today its value is being questioned in the light of        controlled groups of patients . at the moment its use is justified in   certain cardiac and other operations where circulation may be           interrupted for short periods.. in general surgical procedures where    massive, sudden blood loss may be anticipated.. in neurosurgical        operations where a /relaxed/ brain is required.. following acute hypoxiasuch as seen in cardiac arrest.. and perhaps in the therapy of acute    septicemic shock .
