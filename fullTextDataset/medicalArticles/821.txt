Congenital absence of the cystic duct is one of the rare types of anomalies associated with the extrahepatic biliary tract (EHBT). It is often an incidental finding intraoperatively leading to significant implications during the perioperative period.A 25-year-old lady was admitted for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy indicated for recurrent symptoms of right upper quadrant pain with evidence of cholelithiasis on ultrasound. During laparoscopy, the cystic duct could not be identified. After retrieval of the gallbladder, a blind ending orifice resembling an obliterated cystic duct was discovered.
