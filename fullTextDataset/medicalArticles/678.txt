the expression of urine analysis results -dash  observations on the use of a specific gravity correction .                                        urine analyses are very useful for measuring the extent of exposure tocertain toxic substances . the types of specimen obtainable from personsemployed in industry, and the effect of concentration variations are    discussed . in expressing the results of analysis it is shown that a    concentration correction is essential . the correction based on specificgravity is the easiest to apply . the mean specific gravity for persons resident in the u.k. has been found to be around 1.016, a figure        considerably lower than the mean of 1.024 used by many workers          (particularly in the u.s.a.) . the implications of this on the results  of urine analysis are indicated .
