4105. free fatty acid metabolism in chinese hamstersin normal chinese hamsters (cricetulusgriseus) the mean concentration of freefatty acids (ffa) in serum varied fromgroup to group, but was (1) consistently 4to 9 times greater than in rats, dogs,or man; (2) slightly higher than in syrianhamsters; (3) two- to four-fold higherthan in fasting or alloxan-diabetic rats.  theepididymal adipose tissue of the chinesehamster (1) had initial concentrations offfa comparable to those in the rat andsyrian hamster; (2) released, in the sametime interval, 8- to 10-fold more ffain vitro than this tissue of the rat; (3) hadhigher concentrations of ffa after incubationthan the incubated tissue of the rat.the retroperitoneal (perirenal) adipose tissueof the chinese hamster was less ac-tive in release of fatty acids in vitro than theepididymal,
