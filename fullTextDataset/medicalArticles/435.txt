Olive oil is produced from olives in the early harvest period. Olive oil is a healthy oil on its own. However,especially cold-pressed olive oil is a very healthy type of oil. Olive oils are produced by cold press method intwo-phase systems under 22°C. With this production method, the values of vitamin E, phenolic componentsand antioxidant substances that are beneficial for health are at high levels (Matthäus & Brühl, 2003).Differential pulse polarography method, which can determine high and low concentrations with sensitivity,reproducibility, has been used in metal analyses in many samples. Standard addition method was preferred forcontent of Cd and Pb in olive oils. This type of calibration was chosen to minimize the error rate in metalanalyses in oil types. The polarograms of the samples are given in Figure 3 and calibration graphics obtainedby adding standard solutions are given in Figure 4. Analyses of Pb and Cd levels in 5 olive oils are shown inTable 3
