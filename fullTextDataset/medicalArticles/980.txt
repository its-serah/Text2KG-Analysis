air-pantopaque ventriculography in congenital hydrocephalus andmyelomeningocele.a study of the csf pathways by combined pantopaque-airventriculography in infantswith congenital hydrocephalus and myelomeningoceleis presented.  the advantagesof this method are discussed.  combined pantopaqueand air ventriculography providesnot only a demonstration of the extent ofthe hydrocephalus but also the exactlocation and cause of the obstruction.  in infantswith myelomeningocele it permitsthe disclosure of unmanifested hydrocephalusand coexistent intracranial malformations.the early detection of the latter is veryimportant for the complete evaluation,management and prognosis.
