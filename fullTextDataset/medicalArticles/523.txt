3. disturbances of speech in pto lesions if investigated along        quantitative scales of impairment of repetition, understanding and      naming, show a regular interrelation . nomination is the most affected, understanding is less affected . repetition is the best preserved       function (cases 1-4) . the same interrelation of these functions is     found with regard to the verbal body image . however, understanding and naming of parts of the body show far greater disintegration than        understanding and naming of any other categories of words (all cases    presented here) . if the aphasic syndrome is subsiding, finger aphasia  with some other minor disturbances of verbal body image associated with acalculia may persist (case 1) . thus gerstmann's /finger agnosia/ may  represent a partial impairment of the verbal body image and be limited  to finger aphasia .
