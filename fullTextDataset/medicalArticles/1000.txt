Patients receiving corticosteroid treatment for a prolongedperiod of time, such as allograft recipients, patients withsteroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, those with autoimmuneand asthmatic diseases, and many others, manifest side effectsof such treatment. Despite the absence of a marked Cushingsyndrome, protein catabolism [1] and growth impairment [21may result. Clinical observations suggest that patients with anunderlying chronic disease are more prone to catabolism andgrowth failure consequent to corticosteroid treatment than areotherwise healthy individuals. Therefore, it is of paramountimportance to identify those factors leading to corticosteroid induced protein losses and to develop preventative therapeuticstrategies
