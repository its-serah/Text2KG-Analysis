platelet sequestration in man . i. methods .                              current methods of labeling platelets with chromium using             ethylenediamine tetraacetate (edta) as an anticoagulant were found to   cause rapid hepatic sequestration of nearly all the transfused plateletsabout 50 returned to the circulation but then were partially destroyedin the spleen . less than one-third survived . evidence is presented    which indicates that edta is injurious to platelets .                     when an acid-citrate medium that buffered plasma at ph 6.5 was used asan anticoagulant, 36 to 85 of the labeled platelets survived (average,  62 ), and marked temporary sequestration did not occur . studies in     thrombocytopenic persons showed that circulating platelet cr activity   measures the true survival of such transfused platelets .
