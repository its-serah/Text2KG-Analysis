1745. the deaggregation of bovine lens a-crystallinsedimentation equilibrium studies of lensa-crystallin at neutral ph indicate thatthis material is composed of a numberof different sized species.  a study of theeffect of alkali upon a-crystallin indicatesa progressive deaggregation of the ma-terial with increasing ph.  sedimentationequilibrium studies were performed at ph12.8 as well as in guanidine hydrochloride,7 m urea, and with succinylated material.under all of these conditions a molecularheterogeneity was observed.  the dataindicate that independent species coexistedunder most dissociating conditions.  theweight average molecular weights of thesuccinylated, and of the alkali-, urea-,and guanidine hydrochloride-treatedmaterial were found to have an integral relation-ship of 8 4 2 1, respectively.
