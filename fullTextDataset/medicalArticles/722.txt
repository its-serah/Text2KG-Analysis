 results indicate that the age at onset of specific attachments is     generally to be found in the third quarter of the first year, but that  this is preceded by a phase of indiscriminate attachment behavior,. thatthe intensity of specific attachment increases most in the first month  following onset and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individual    cases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that multiplicity of objects can be found in some instances at the very beginning of the  specific attachment phase, becoming the rule in most of the remaining   cases very soon thereafter .
