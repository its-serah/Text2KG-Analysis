Growth hormone prevents steroid.induced growth depression in healthand uremia. Treatment with supraphysiological doses of corticosteroidsresults in protein wasting and impairment of growth, whereas exoge- nous growth hormone (GH) causes anabolism and improvement ofgrowth. We wanted to know whether the growth depressing effects ofmethylprednisolone (MP) are more expressed in an organism which ischronically diseased and whether these effects can be counterbalancedby concomitant treatment with recombinant human growth hormone(rhGH). MP in doses from 1 to 9 mg/kg/day caused a dose dependentreduction of length gain, weight gain and weight gain/food intake ratioin 140 g healthy female Sprague-Dawley rats. Food intake was not affected by MP. This points to a change in food metabolism as amechanism for growth impairment.
