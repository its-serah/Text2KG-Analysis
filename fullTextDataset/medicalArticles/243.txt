   experiences with hgh treatment of twelve hypopituitarydwarfs for periods varying from 6 to 41 monthsare reported.  all the patients were considered to havehypopituitarism from birth, four of them of the hereditarytype, four possibly due to traumatic birth or neonatal asphyxia,and four from an unknown cause.  in sixpatients detailed information concerning growth duringthe first year of life could be obtained.  all of these patientshad a degree of growth retardation before oneyear of age.  we consider this to be the rule rather thanthe exception in pituitary dwarfism.  the most importantdiagnostic evidence was a marked degree of growth retardationaccompanied by a pronounced delay in skeletalmaturation, and, in most cases, signs of secondaryhypothyroidism, increased insulin sensitivity, and apoor response to metopyrone administration.  none ofthe patients who had passed the normal age of pubertyhad maturated sexually.
