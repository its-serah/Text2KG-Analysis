For this reason, neutrophils in these species are also termed pseudoeosinophils or heterophils (Campbell, 2012;Hawkey, 1975;Hein, 2014;Jain, 1993;Merten, 2011;Zimmerman et al., 2010), which may also apply for the neutrophils of the common marmoset. Aside from their staining behavior, pseudoeosinophils of the rabbit and guinea pig equal mammalian neutrophils regarding electron microscopic, functional and biochemical properties (Campbell, 2012;Hawkey, 1975;Hein, 2014;Jain, 1993;Merten, 2011;Zimmerman et al., 2010). Most likely, this is also true for the marmoset neutrophils since their ultrastructural features are similar to that of 'normal' neutrophils in other primate species (Huser and Webb, 1967), and in a recently established LPS model marmosets react as expected for this type of inflammation with distinct blood, BAL, and tissue neutrophilia (Seehase et al., 2012). ...
