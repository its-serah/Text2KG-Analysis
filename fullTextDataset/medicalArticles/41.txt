The frequent contamination of animal celllines by pleuropneumonia-like organisms (PPLO)reported by Robinson, Wichelhausen, andRoizman (1956) and by Collier (1957) is ofobvious consequence to research workers usingtissue culture systems. The presence of thesemicroorganisms could influence results obtainedin diverse studies, for example, of nutritiverequirements of the cells or of viral antigensgrown in them. The cultural methods commonlyemployed for the demonstration of PPLO havebeen somewhat complicated, but they are notdifficult with the medium of Barile, Yaguchi,and Eveland (1958).Â
