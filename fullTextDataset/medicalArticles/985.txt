aspects of circadian periodic changes inphosphorus metabolism in micekinetic studies on the p32 content ofmouse brain phosphorus fractions followingthe intraperitoneal injection of p32-labeledorthophosphate were performed duringtwo selected segments of the 24-hour time scale.the results of these studies suggestthat the circadian periodicity in relativespecific activity of brain phospholipidsis probably a consequence of a variation in the extentof p32 incorporation into braininorganic phosphate and is not indicativeof a periodicity in the rate of intermediaryphospholipid metabolism.
