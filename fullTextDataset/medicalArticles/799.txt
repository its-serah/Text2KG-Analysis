surgical treatment of ventricular septal defect .                         the surgical technique of closure of ventricular septal defects in 80 cases (37 cases of isolated defects and 43 cases of tetralogy of fallot)is discussed in the light of the follow-up results . the use of a patch for closure has reduced the incidence of recurrence to 4 percent, com-  pared with 18 percent when direct suture was performed . the incidence  of heart block also decreased from 15 percent, when direct suture was   used, to 4 percent with a patch . the transatrial approach is preferred for isolated ventricular septal defects,. the ventricular approach is   preferred for cases with tetralogy of fallot .
