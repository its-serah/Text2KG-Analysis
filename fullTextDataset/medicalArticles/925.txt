4612. flow considerations in regional cerebral hypothermiait is suggested that low flows are dangerousand may cause anoxia either directlyor by interfering with cooling.  sixty dogshave been subjected to local cerebralhypothermia by the method of femoral tocarotid cooling of arterial blood with per-fusion at a predetermined pressure ratherthan predetermined flow rate.  the cir-cuit is described and its advantages forclinical use mentioned together with its in-accuracies as a method of scientific investigation.these are chiefly concernedwith maintenance of systemic blood pressurewhich may require the injection ofpressor agents.  evidence for reduction in flowat low temperatures is discussedand evidence presented that this is not only dueto increase in viscosity but thatthere is an active spasm, manifested by'rewarming humps' which occur in thecooling graphs.
