974. extracorporeal hypothermia without thoracotomy.  an ex-perimental study in the use of cold for neurosurgery andcancericidal perfusionsthis paper includes minor clinical noteson open heart surgery and cancer perfusionbut contains no experimental informationon neurosurgery or cancer perfusions.  amethod of closed-chest hypothermic perfusionin 30 dogs is reported.  the authorsutilize drainage of superior and inferior cavaeby gravity.  the volume of venousdrainage sometimes enhanced by transfusionsor 12.5% low molecular weight dex-tran determined the flow rate.  cooling wasmaintained for quite variable periodsapparently generally to an unspecifiedesophageal temperature.  perfusion time va-ried from 30 min. to 4 hr.
