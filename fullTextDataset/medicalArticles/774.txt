4159. detection of heart shunts by means of i 125external scintillation detection of a pure dilutioncurve originating in the right ven-tricle has been pursued by investigators for manyyr.  the use of the soft photonsof 125 i offers an improved method of determinationby allowing excellent collimationthrough 2 mechanisms  (1) a small half value layerof 2 cm in tissue, and (2) uni-directionality, in part due to all-or-none photoelectricabsorption of these photonsas compared with the pluridirectionality due to comptonscatter in the case of 131 i.in 30 normal individuals, externally detected dilutioncurves from the right heartventricle and arterial dilution curves obtained by arterialpuncture are compared.five hundred microcuries of 125 i are injected into anantecubital vein.
