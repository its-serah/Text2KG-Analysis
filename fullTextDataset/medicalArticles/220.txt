The first report of a mycoplasma to be recovered directly from a human and associated with a pathological condition occurred in 1937, when Dienes and Edsall isolated an organism which was probably the one known now as Mycoplasma hominis from a Bartholin's gland abscess (76). At that time, mycoplasmas were called pleuropneumonia-like organisms because the microbe now known as Mycoplasma mycoides had been shown to cause bovine pleuropneumonia. The term mycoplasma (Greek: mykes = fungus and plasma = formed) was first used to describe the pleuropneumonia-like organisms in the 1950s.
