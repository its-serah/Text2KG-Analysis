the role of age and x-irradiation on kidneyfunction in the mousefemale mouse kidneys show a decline with respect to age in the ability toconcentrate the urine during a 24-hour water fast.  x-irradiation early inlife has no measurable long-term effect on this process.kidney cortex slices of old female mice can concentrate p-aminohippuricacid against a concentration gradient equally as well as slices from youngmice.  there is no loss in this ability by cortex slices from young or oldfemale x-irradiated mice.it is uncertain whether compensatory renal hypertrophy after unilateralnephrectomy declines with age in nonirradiated mice.  x-irradiation doescause a reduction in the degree of compensatory renal hypertrophy in the agingmouse.  this reduction may represent a loss in the ability of kidney cells toundergo cell division.
