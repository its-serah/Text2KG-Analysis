froma group of 295 asymptomatic microfilariae-negativeindividuals, 21 sera (7%) werepositive.  testing 632 sera from 295 normalmissionaries, 84 normal americans,and 253 individuals with various other parasiticand bacterial infections, an overallnon-specific response of 10% was obtained,utilizing the following criteria for apositive serologic test: (1) haemagglutinationtitre of 1:200 or higher with a positiveflocculation of 1:5 or higher, or (2) a haemagglutinationtitre of 1:400 with a negativeflocculation reaction.  sera from 141 patientswith helminth diseases showed a non-specificrate of 21%.  this high rate was dueto cross-reactions with trichinosissera (35%), schistosomiasis (20%) and ascariasis (27%).since the schistosomiasisand ascariasis sera were from individuals bornin an area endemic for filariasis,the reactions may represent a serologic responseto past experience with filariasis.
