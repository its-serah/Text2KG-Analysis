posterior scalloping of vertebral bodies in uncontrolled hydrocephalus.two cases of extensive posterior scallopingof the vertebral bodies are presentedin men aged 17 and 23 years, havinglong-standing hydrocephalus.  twoadditional cases with scalloping of only onelumbar vertebra when partially controlledhydrocephalus has been present for a shortertime are also noted.  no previousassociation between these entities has beenrecorded.  it is supposed that the increasedintraspinal pressure which must havebeen present in the first 2 patients formany years, was present near the time ofclosure of the epiphysis at the junction ofthe arch and the bodies and caused not onlywidening of the spinal canal but alsoexcavation of the vertebral bodies.
