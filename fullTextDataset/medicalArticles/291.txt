 1949. studies on the soluble proteins of bovine lens.  immuno-chemical analyses of protein fractionsthe lyophilized soluble lens proteinswere dissolved in 0.005 m phosphate bufferat ph 6.8 and the solution was subjected tocolumn chromatography on deae (die-thylamino ethyl) cellulose.  elution wasaccomplished by changing the ph and ionicstrength of the eluting buffer.  the componentswere fractionated by stepwise elu-tion.  the lens proteins were separated into17 fractions by column chromatogra-phy.  these fractions were compared witha, b and y crystallines for electrophore-tic mobility, and the antigenic purity of eachfraction was examined immunochemi-cally.
