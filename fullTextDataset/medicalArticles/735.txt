chemotherapy of breast cancerthe majority of cancer patients who arereferred for chemotherapy are in far advancedstages of the disease.  the difficulty in deliver-ing an effective dose of an oncolytic agentto the involved areas may limit the results oftreatment unless the patient's tumor is an un-usually responsive one.  the variability in re-sponse between apparently similar cases ofcancer of the same cell type has become in-creasingly evident, and is as puzzling as thefact that 20 per cent of patients with breastcancer will live 5 years with no treatment.  thedecisions as to the choice between chemother-apy and hormone therapy, as well as to thechoice of the chemotherapeutic agent to beemployed, may be difficult.
