Biliary atresia (BA) and choledochal cysts are diseases of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. While their exact etiopathogeneses are not known, they should be treated promptly due to the potential for irreversible parenchymal liver disease. A diagnosis of BA may be easy or complicated, but should not be delayed. BA is always treated surgically, and performing the surgery before the age of 2 mo greatly increases its effectiveness and extends the time until the need for liver transplantation arises. While the more common types of choledochal cysts require surgical treatment, some can be treated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Choledochal cysts may cause recurrent cholangitis and the potential for malignancy should not be ignored.
