Where studies report on the release of nickel from different grades of stainless steels,many of these have been undertaken under non-standardised conditions prior tointroduction of the European Standardised method, EN 1811. This study hasmeasured nickel release from a number of different stainless steels but with differingcompositions using three fluids (artificial sweat, blood plasma and urine) likely to bein contact with the post assemblies during the period of epithilization. The resultshave shown that stainless steel of similar composition will release nickel at differentrates dependent on their surface finish. For finished stainless steel wires andcommercial stainless steel piercing post assemblies the release of nickel cannot bemeasured, as any value for nickel release is below the limit of detection of theinstrumentation (0.01 µg/cm²/week).
