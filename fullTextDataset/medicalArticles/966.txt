an autoradiographic study on cell migration in the eye lens epithelium  from normal and alloxan diabetic rats .lenses from normal and alloxan diabetic rats with and without cataractwere investigated by autoradiography 4 hours, 4 days and 8 days after anintraperitoneal injection of h3-thymidine (0.4 uc/g body weight) . the  rats were made diabetic 8 days prior to the injection of thymidine at anage of 4 weeks . the position of labelled nuclei of the lens epithelium was noted and their grain numbers counted . the diabetic rats had a     lower frequency of labelled nuclei than the controls but after 4 hours  their grain counts were equal .
