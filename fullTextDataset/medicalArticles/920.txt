functional craniology: an aid ininterpreting roentgenogramsof the skullanalysis of the form of the skull isfacilitated by considering it to be composedof a number of functional components.  forthe roentgenologist's purposes, division intothe facial or somatic skeleton and the neu-ral skeleton is valuable, as is the recognitionof three functionally separate portionswithin each calvarial bone: the inner table,the diploe and the outer table.the base of the skull is the only por-tion that is preformed in cartilage.  this ac-counts for the unusual appearance of theskull in achondroplasia.  in addition, thebase apparently is more closely related tofacial and general somatic growth than toneural growth.calvarial bone forms directly frommembrane within the cerebral capsule.consequently, the size and shape of the cal-varia directly reflect the form of the grow-ing neural mass.
