The median follow up was 11.5 months. The 1- and 2-year LPFS rate was 34.9% and 20%, respectively. The multivariate analysis indicated recurrence site (central or pelvic wall) (hazard ratio [HR]=0.294; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.121–0.718), lesion volume (HR=2.898; 95% CI=1.139–7.372), D90 (HR=0.332; 95% CI=0.130–0.850) were the independent factors affecting LPFS. The 1- and 2-year OS rate was 52.0% and 19.6%, respectively. The multivariate analysis suggested pathological type (HR=9.713; 95% CI=2.136–44.176) and recurrence site (HR=0.358; 95% CI=0.136–0.940) were the independent factors affecting OS. The dosimetric parameters of 33 patients mainly included D90 (128.5±47.4 Gy), D100 (50.4±23.7 Gy) and V100 (86.7%±12.9%). When D90 ≥105 Gy or D100 ≥55 Gy or V100 ≥91%, LPFS was extended significantly, but no significant difference for OS. The 79.2% of 24 patients with local pain were suffering from pain downgraded after radioactive 125I seed implantation.
