1116. na, k, ca, mg, and cl concentrations in choroid plexus fluidand cisternal fluid compared with plasma ultrafiltratein 7 cats the concentrations of na,k, ca, mg, and cl were measured in plasmaultrafiltrate, newly formed choroidplexus fluid, and cisterna magna fluid.  thechoroid plexus fluid did not differfrom plasma ultrafiltrate in cl and k concentra-tion but contained higher na, markedlyhigher mg, and lower ca concentrationsthan the ultrafiltrate.  cisterna magnafluid differed from the ultrafiltrate withrespect to all 5 electrolytes, containinghigher concentrations of cl, na, and mgand lower concentrations of k and ca.
