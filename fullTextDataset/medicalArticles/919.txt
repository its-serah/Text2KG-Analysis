auto-radiographic studies of the protein metabolism of the singlekidney in the nephrectomized rat.rats were subjected to unilateral nephrectomy,following which the protein metabolismof the other kidney, which exerteda compensatory activity, was studiedwith h-labelled l-phenylalanine, at differentintervals (3hr. to 7 wk.).  twophases of enhanced incorporation of amino-acidsinto the cells of the convolutedtubules were found, with one maximumafter 6 hr., at which time the uptake islimited to the cytoplasm, and a 2nd maximumon the 4th day, when the nucleus isequally involved.  in the course of the 2ndphase of enhanced amino-acid uptake,there is also an increased mitotic indexof the epithelia of the tubules.
