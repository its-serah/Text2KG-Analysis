Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors located in the adrenal medulla, that derives from the chromaffin cells and produce catecholamines. They are an uncommon cause of hypertension, and only 50% of the patients present symptoms compatible with this pathology. Here we describe the case of a 70-year-old woman with a history of anxiety, hypertension and palpitation, who had an unspecified nodule in the right adrenal gland. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated urinary metanephrines secretion. A diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was made and an adrenalectomy was performed. Our aim is to highlight the diagnosis of this rare tumor and how its early management can prevent morbidity and mortality.
