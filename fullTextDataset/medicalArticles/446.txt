815. the origin of macrophagesfrom bone marrow in the ratskin windows' and subcutaneous coverslipswere applied to rats in a study designedto identify the tissues in which the precursorsof macrophages proliferate.  lympho-cyte-depletion by either chronic drainage fromthe thoracic duct or 400 rads of x-irradiation failed to suppress the emigration ofmacrophages or to reduce the pro-portion of them which became labelled after aninjection of tritiated thymidine.  x-irradiation with 750 rads suppressedthe emigration and the labelling of the exudatemacrophages.  both were restored tonormal when the tibial marrow was shieldedduring irradiation.
