The fluoropyrimidines, namely 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its oral prodrug, capecitabine, are the third most commonly used chemotherapeutic class for the treatment of solid tumors of glandular and squamous origin, such as head and neck, esophageal, stomach, and bladder. Use of fluoropyrimidines is standard of care for treatment of advanced colorectal cancers and may have synergetic effects with external beam radiation to enhance the radiosensitivity of tumors.1Â However, among conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies, 5-FU is likely one of the most common chemotherapeutic agents to cause cardiotoxicity, second only to anthracyclines. Reported clinical manifestations have largely been consistent with angina attributed to coronary vasospasm, although myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, pericarditis, coronary dissection, QT prolongation, and sudden cardiac death have also been reported in the setting of fluoropyrimidine use.2
