transduction in bacillus subtilis .                                       (i) comparative examinations have shown that the temperate subtilis   phages can be divided into two groups . b. subtilis strain nrs 231 was  an adequate common host sensitive to all the examined temperate phages .  owing to certain technical advantages this strain was found suitable  for the titration subtilis phages .                                       (ii) some cultural differences have been revealed among substrains of b. subtilis 168 ind auxotrophs maintained in various laboratories .     cells in one of these cultures were partly capable and partly incapable of using ammonia . ammonia assimilation was transducible to ammonia     negative bacteria .                                                       (iii) after mitomycin c or ultraviolet ray induction the examined b.  subtilis strains liberated /bacteriocin/-like principles . this finding is probably analogous to that of seaman et al. concerning pbsx defectivephages . on the basis of bacteriocin production the examined strains    were divided into two groups .
