electron microscopic studies of mycoplasma (pplo strain 880) inartificial medium and in tissue culture.mycoplasma strain 880, isolated from a leukemicpatient, was studied in brothcultures and in several cell culture lines.this strain exhibited considerable pleomorphismin size, internal structure, andshape, including forms with filamentousprojections.  the most common form observedwas 0.5 to 1 in diameter andhad a nuclear area of fibrillar strands, probablydna.  the cytoplasm of the organismscontained ribosome-like granules anda flattened vacuole which indented thenuclear area.
