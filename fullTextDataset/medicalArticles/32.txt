4396. effects of arginine deprivation, ultraviolet radiation,and x-radiation on cultured kb cells.  a cytochemical andultrastructural studycultured kb cells (derived from ahuman oral carcinoma) grown in monolayerswere injured by one of three agentsstarvation by arginine deprivation or treatmentwith high doses of either ultravioletradiation or x-radiation.  the different agentsproduced changes in nucleolar structureand varying accumulations of triglycerideand glycogen.  all three agents producedan increase in number and size of lyso-somes.  these were studied in acidphosphatase preparations, viewed by both lightand electron microscopy, and, occasionally,in vital dye, esterase, and aryl sul-fatase preparations.
