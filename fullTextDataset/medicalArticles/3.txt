evoked response in visual disorders .                                     1. erg and ver have been recorded from eyelid and lateral occipital   electrodes in response to diffuse stroboscopic stimulation . in 45      normal subjects ver was found to be composed of an early triphasic      potential arising from the occipital region . wave i was present in 67  percent of subjects, wave ii in 97 percent, and wave iii in 100 percent later waves were inconstant and contained components from the vertex  reference . no overall asymmetry in ver from right to left was found in normal subjects, although average asymmetry with smaller side compared  to larger was 19 percent 12.5 . on monocular stimulation the            contralateral ver was regularly larger than the ipsilateral reflecting  predominant retinal representation of the temporal field .
