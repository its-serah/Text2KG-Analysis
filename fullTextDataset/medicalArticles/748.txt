studies of the generalized shwartzman reaction induced by diet vi.      effects of pregnancy on lipid composition of serum and tissues .          pregnancy induced profound alterations in the lipid composition of    serum and tissues . (1) there is an elevation of total serum lipid,     phospholipid, triglyceride, free fatty acid and cholesterol,. (2) while the total lipid of the liver and kidney are increased, that of the depotfat is decreased,. (3) palmitate and oleate are increased in serum and  liver,. (4) arachidonate and stearate are decreased in serum and liver,.and (5) placentas contain more stearate than the other organs of the    pregnant rat and also have a higher water content . the decrease in     depot total fat,. elevation of serum, liver and kidney total fat,. and  elevation of serum free fatty acids suggest that pregnancy induced      mobilization of depot fat .
