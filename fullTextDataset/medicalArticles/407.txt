resistance to human growth hormone in pituitary dwarfism:clinical and immunologic studiesthirteen pituitary dwarfs havebeen treated with human growth hormone(hgh), and growth acceleration with doses of5-7 mg/week has been observed in all but onepatient.  on therapy, this 7 1/2-year-old girl grewat a rate of 1.05 cm/month for 7 months.thereafter, despite larger doses of growthhormone (15 mg/week), growth rate fell to0.27 cm/month.  this rate of growth persistedafter stopping hgh.  on retreatment on 2occasions, acceleration of growth did notoccur.  antibodies to hgh, absent in herserum before treatment, were repeatedlydemonstrated in her serum in high concentra-tion (hgh binding capacity up to 100 mg/1)during treatment.
