long-term prognosis and the response of schizophrenic childrento drug therapy: a controlled study of trifluoperazine.   it is evident from this study that treatment andcontrol groups must be matched for severity of illness,since this affects the responsiveness to pharmacologicalas well as to other types of treatments.  the use ofthe double-blind technique does not of itself guaranteea well-controlled study; the comparison of 2 or moretreatment regimes may be misleading if the groups arenot matched, or if the matching is not based on criticalfactors.  in this study, both the response to the nonpharmacologicaspects of treatment and the type ofresponse to the drug itself were related to the initialseverity of language impairment.
