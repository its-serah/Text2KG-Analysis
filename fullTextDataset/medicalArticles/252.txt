The World Federation of Hemophilia estimates that more than 350,000 people globally have a form of the disease. Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder that has a spectrum of manifestations ranging from persistent bleeding after minor trauma to spontaneous hemorrhage. We report a case of a male patient with hemophilia A who received general anesthesia for removal of foreign body from the nose. There was no excessive blood loss during surgery. Perioperatively, the patient received recombinant factor VIII coverage. Rest of the postoperative course was uneventful. Literature on the clinical management of patient with hemophilia A are reviewed and considerations for perioperative preparation and management of hemophilic patient are presented.
