surgical treatment of atrial septal defect under hypothermia .            the technique of inflow occlusion under 30 c. hypothermia was adopted for direct visual correction in 133 consecutive cases of atrial septal  defect of the secundum variety and the associated anomalies .             the use of extracorporeal circulation combined with hypothermia was   reserved for the repair of two cases of ostium primum defects .           the over-all operative mortality was 4 .                                post-operative evaluation showed that the results have been good in   almost all patients, including those with pulmonary hypertension .        since an ostium primum defect requires cardio-pulmonary bypass for itsclosure, the pre-operative recognition of the defect is highly desirablein the selection of patients for operation and in planning the procedureitself .
