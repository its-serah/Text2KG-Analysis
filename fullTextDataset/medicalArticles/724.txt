      a significantly lower amount of estradiol was noted in the group of     women with mammary carcinoma as compared to the amount found in the     group of women with benign mammary dysplasia, suggesting that the formergroup metabolizes more rapidly the administered estradiol . although theexcretion patterns of patients who failed to respond to estrogen        treatment (nonresponders) differed the greatest from the patterns       associated with benign disease, distinctive patterns of the urinary     excretion of isotopic estrogens which allowed a statistically           significant or clinically useful separation between responders and      nonresponders to subsequent estrogen therapy were not discovered .
