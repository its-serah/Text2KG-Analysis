the behavior of lymphocytes in primary explants of human lung cancer in vitro .                                                                   the activity of lymphocytes within outgrowths from explanted tissue   fragments of 20 human lung cancers has been studied . the study includedcancer-bearing tissue explants from all cases and noncancerbearing lung tissue from 4 of the 20 cases . five major categories of lymphocytic    behavior were derived from the study, namely.. (1) emigration and       migration of lymphocytes from the explant,. (2) clustering of           lymphocytes around /target/ cells,. (3) ameboid transformation of       lymphocytes,. (4) lymphocytic congregation,. and (5) emperipolesis .    criteria for these different lymphocytic activities have been amplified or introduced .
