Renal function is noticeably altered in both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. However, clinical studies on thyroid dysfunction and its association with renal function are scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in biochemical parameters of renal function in subjects with thyroid dysfunction and to correlate these values with the patient's thyroid profile. The effect of changes in thyroid function during therapy on renal function was also investigated.AÂ prospective cohort study included 41 patients with untreated primary hypothyroidism and 16 patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, and free triiodothyronine were assessed using immunoassay. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Renal function tests were assessed in all patients at each of the two-time points: during thyroid dysfunction (hypo- or hyperthyroidism) and after attaining euthyroidism.
