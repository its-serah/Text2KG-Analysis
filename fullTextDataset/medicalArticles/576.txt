measurement of oxygen tensions in cerebral tissues of rats exposed to   high pressures of oxygen .                                                brain and cerebrospinal oxygen tensions have been measured in rats    breathing air or in various high pressures of oxygen (ohp) . addition of5 percent co2 to the inspired oxygen raised cerebral oxygen tensions    when rats were exposed to 2 atm abs or above . inhibition of 75         hemoglobin saturation by para-aminopropriophenone lowered cerebral po inrats breathing air, but not in rats exposed to ohp . the rate of rise ofcerebral po to a steady level after rapid compression was found to be   faster than the rate of fall to a steady level following decompression .addition of co to the inspired gas mixture increased the rate of rise ofcerebral po .
