the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .            the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat contains            characteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures but  basically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limiting     membrane of the unit type .                                               inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradation  which occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . someinclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presented     suggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involved in the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associated  with the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusion      bodies .
