438. lag period characterizing the entry of transforming deoxyribonucleic acidinto bacillus subtilisthe kinetics of appearance of transformantsas a function of time of exposure todna has been studied.  a short lag periodof approximately 1 min at 37 c is evi-dent when the transformation is terminatedwith deoxyribonuclease.  the length ofthis lag is independent of the genetic traittransferred.  moreover, the lag is unaf-fected by transforming dna concentration,by the presence of homologous unmarkeddna, and by shearing and cross-linking ofthe transforming dna.
