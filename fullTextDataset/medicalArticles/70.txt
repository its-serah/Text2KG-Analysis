B. subtilis is a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) microorganism [1], which is famous for its strong ability for heterologous expression, clear physiological and biochemical characteristics, and legacy relatively simple to operate. In addition, they have the advantages of being easy to cultivate and robust in industrial fermentations [2]. Using B. subtilis as the chassis cell, the exogenous introduction of the desired synthetic pathway and the systematic optimization of the strain’s own global metabolism and the coordination of the balance between the strain’s metabolic network and the exogenous pathway allow for the efficient production of a large number of products. As a crucial industrial biotechnology powerful chassis cell, B. subtilis produces valuable enzymes and biopolymers.
