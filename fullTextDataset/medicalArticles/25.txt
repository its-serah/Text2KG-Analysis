autoradiographic study on the origin and fate of small lymphoid cells inthe dog bone marrow.. effect of femoral artery clamping during in vivo  availability of h3-thymidine .                                            the origin and fate of small lymphoid cells in the dog bone marrow    were studied autoradiographically by observing the effect of clamping ofthe femoral artery during in vivo availability of h3-thymidine . heavilylabeled small lymphoid cells appeared in the bone marrow of the clamped leg 3 hours after injection of the tracer and increased in number up to 6 days . the labeling indices of these cells, however, were             significantly lower than those of control marrow . a possible           interpretation is that dog bone marrow contains two populations of smalllympho id cells, one migrating into the marrow via the blood stream.
