frontal lobes and vision .                                                the influence of the frontal lobe on vision is discussed based on the presentation of a rather unusual case . after the operation of a right  frontal brain abscess, which never had led to papilledema, there was a  pronounced diminution of the visual capacities of the patient,.         gradually these disturbances regressed to the point of return of full   visual acuity,. but there remained a hemianopic field defect . this and psychological defects in the sense of a partial visual agnosia (which   latter are also regressing very well) prompted a discussion of those    neuroanatomical and neurophysiological observations pertinent to the    findings in this patient .
