3762. aberrant left coronary arteryfive cases of aberrant coronary artery arepresented, with emphasis on the angio-graphic features and differentiation fromendocardial fibroelastosis.  clinical andelectrocardiographic features may suggestthe proper diagnosis, but only angio-graphy can conclusively demonstrate thecontinuity between the pulmonary arteryand the left coronary artery.  in these cases,blood flow was from the pulmonaryartery to the coronary artery (forward) in 2cases, and from the coronary arteryto the pulmonary artery (retrograde) in theother 3.  when the diagnosis of aberrantcoronary artery is suspected, selectiveleft-sided angiocardiography should be theangiographic procedure of choice.
