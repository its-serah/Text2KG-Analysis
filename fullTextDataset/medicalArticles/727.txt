a study on the direction of inscription of the vectorcardiographic      t-loop in left and right ventricular hypertrophy .                        (1) frank lead vectorcardiogram was recorded in 30 normal persons and in 323 cases with hypertension and acquired and congenital heart diseasethe t-loop was classified into 8 types according to the directions of inscription in 3 planar projections . frequently observed types were    examined with the direction of the maximal t vector .                     (2) in majority of normal cases, the t-loop was inscribed             counterclockwise in horizontal and clockwise in sagittal planes .         (3) in left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal inscription of the      t-loop was observed with abnormal rightward and superior deviation of   its maximal vector and the t-loop oriented more than 120 in horizontal  plane was usually accompanied by abnormal inscription . percentage of   abnormal inscription was higher in cases with cardiac complaints .
