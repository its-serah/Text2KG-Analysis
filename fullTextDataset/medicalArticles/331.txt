postural changes in blood distribution and its relation to the change incardiac output .                                                          (1) cardiac output and the blood content indices of the several parts of the body were measured in 18 subjects including patients with variousdiseases using external radioisotope counting techniques . changes in   these 2 parameters induced by standing were compared with each other .    (2) average changes in blood distribution produced by standing were asfollows . decrease in blood content in the /lung/ (-25 ) and in the     /heart/ (-26 ) and increase in the /thigh/ (+56 ) were statistically    significant . no significant change was revealed in the /head/, /palm/, /liver/ and /abdomen/ .
