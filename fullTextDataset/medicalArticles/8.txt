2. a statistically determined criterion of 50 percent depression in   wave ii successfully identifies most patients with hemianopic defects   involving the central 10 percent of visual field on tangent screen      campimetry .                                                              latency asymmetry of six msec. or more and grossly asymmetrical       aberrant wave forms are seen in some patients with diffuse cerebral     disease and hemianopic defects .                                          3. severe or diffuse retinal disease is associated with alteration or loss of erg and ver on stimulation of the involved eye .                  4. optic nerve disease is indicated by bilateral loss or suppression  of ver on stimulation of the involved eye . erg is normal .               5. bilateral prechiasmal involvement is associated with complete      suppression of ver . if only waves i and ii are lost, disease is        probably, but not conclusively, demonstrated .
