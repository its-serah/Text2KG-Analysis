2716. y-angiocardiographyrecordings were made, simultaneously withthe y-cardiogram, of a pulmonary an-giogram by means of a collimator placed inthe left scapular region and of carotidangiogram by a collimator centered on the axisof the external auditory canal.  the3 curves yielded very interesting information onthe chronology of the various car-diac cycles.  the pattern of the pulmonary andcarotid y-angiograms was valuablein several pathologic conditions.  it is more logicalto measure the cardiac outputon the carotid curve than on the y-cardiogram,especially if there are shunts.  thepulmonary curve allows rectification of the timeconstant of emptying of the leftcavities of the heart.
