the immunological development of the humanfetusthe normal human fetus is said not to be engaged in the formation of immuno-globulins; the immunoglobulins present in the serum of the fetus and thenewborn are considered to be of maternal origin.  in favor of this opinion isthe observation that directly after birth the serum of the newborn contains anappreciable amount of igg, with gm groups identical with those of the mother(68-70).  the level of the igg of the neonate decreases gradually during thefirst 3 months (3,27,71), which is generally explained by the catabolism ofthe maternal igg, whereas the formation by the newborn infant is stillinadequate to maintain the original level (16,27).
