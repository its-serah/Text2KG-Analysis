Representative exposure data are difficult to obtain, and most published values of occupational exposure were gained during biological monitoring studies. US NIOSH (1977b) compiled data on the concentrations of nickel in air, in smelting and refining operations, the alloy industry, welding operations, and other processes; the concentrations ranged from a few µg/m3 to several mg/m3. Recent exposure data from the primary and secondary nickel industries are summarized in Table 15. Levels may vary considerably, according to the individual operations, or areas of a manufacturing process. For example, in alloy production an average concentration of airborne nickel during pickling and handling was determined to be 0.008 mg/m3, whereas, during grinding,the average airborne nickel level was 0.298 mg/m3 (Warner, 1984).
