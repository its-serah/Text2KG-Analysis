hydrocephalus: changes in formation and absorptionof cerebrospinal fluid within thecerebral ventriclesformation, flow and absorption ofcerebrospinal fluid were measured in normaland progressively hydrocephalic dogs bysteady-state studies during ventricular per-fusion.  the formation of cerebrospinal fluidwas found to be constant, independent ofhydrostatic pressure, and unaffected by thedevelopment of hydrocephalus.  the normaldog produced 0.016 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min. in the lateral ventricles, 0.011 ml. cere-brospinal fluid/min. in the 4th ventricle and0.20 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min. in the sub-arachnoid space.  the intraventricular forma-tion of fluid was calculated to be 0.24 ml.cerebrospinal fluid/min./gm. of choroidplexus, and 0.3x10-3 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min./cm.2 of ependymal surface.
