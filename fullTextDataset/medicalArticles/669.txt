chemical aspects of compensatory renal hypertrophythe effect of unilateral nephrectomy on the size and composition of theremaining kidney has been investigated in rats.  in normal rats the rightkidney is, on the average, significantly heavier than the left and has ahigher total content of dna and rna.  the 2 kidneys have almost identicalratios of rna/dna and protein/dna.  after unilateral nephrectomy the survivingkidney increases steadily in wet and dry weight for the 1st 4 days after theoperation.  this is accompanied by a much slower increase in total dnacontent and by a dramatic increase in rna/dna ratio.the rna/dna ratio in kidney is also affected by diet, being higher on ahigh-protein than on a low-protein intake.
