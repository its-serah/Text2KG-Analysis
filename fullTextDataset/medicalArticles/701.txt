The morphologic similarities of the microfilariae and their infrequency in clinical specimens in settings of endemicity present challenges to clinical laboratories in maintaining competence for accurate identification and differentiation. We present here a review of the primary filarial nematodes causing human infection, including an illustrated key, which we hope will improve the diagnostic capabilities of hematologists, microbiologists, medical technologists, and similarly qualified laboratorians.Filariasis is an infection with nematodes in the superfamily Filarioidea. Causative agents of human filariasis include Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, Loa loa, Mansonella perstans, Mansonella ozzardi, Mansonella streptocerca, and Onchocerca volvulus (1) (Table 1). In addition, humans can become infected with several zoonotic filarial nematodes, including other Onchocerca and Brugia species, Dirofilaria species, and others of uncertain affiliations (2).
