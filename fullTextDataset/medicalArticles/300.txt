3716. glycolytic control mechanisms. i. inhibition of glycolysisby acetate and pyruvate in the isolated, perfused rat heartacetate or pyruvate had similar effectson the over-all metabolism of glucose.  gly-colytic flux was decreased in both thepresence and absence of insulin, glucoseoxidation was greatly decreased, andthe conversion of glucose to glycogen and lac-tate was promoted.  glucose phosphorylationwas decreased in the presence but notin the absence of insulin.  hexokinase,phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde phos-phate dehydrogenase, and pyruvic kinaseare far displaced from equilibrium, whilethe other enzymic steps of glycolysisare maintained either at equilibrium or fairlyclose to equilibrium.
