1362. the synthesis of phage and host dna in the establishment of lysogenya method of extraction is described whichprevents excessive fragmentation of bac-terial dna.  the larger bacterial dna canthen be separated from the phage dnaon sucrose gradients.  the relative amountsof phage and host dna made at varioustimes during infection of s. typhimuriumwith phage p22 leading to lysogeny havebeen determined.  phage-specific dnasynthesis begins at about 4 min, continuesto increase for 2-4 min, and then decreasesuntil complete repression is attainedat 16 min.
