genetic transcription during morphogenesis .                              messenger rna's from bacillus subtilis undergoing sporulation,        germination, or step-down transition have been characterized and        compared . hybrid competition experiments indicate that these messengersare derived from distinct genetic loci . the results are consistent withthe hypothesis that differential transcription of the genome occurs     during morphogenesis . the data also complement previously observed     changes in morphology and enzymatic activity in sporulating bacteria .
 the ancillary procedure, viz., congo-red test, gingival and liver     biopsies proved to be of limited value in the diagnosis of renal        amyloidosis .                                                             the importance of percutaneous renal biopsy as a diagnostic tool has  been emphasised .
