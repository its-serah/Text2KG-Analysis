Pertussis toxin is apparently the same protein as the islet-activating protein, leukocyte-promoting factor, late appearing toxic factor, and mouseprotective antigen (1). Pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates a protein which binds guanine nucleotides and is involved in regulation of adenylate cyclase (2, 3).Garcia-Sainz (4) has shown that the administration ofpertussis vaccine markedly reduced the inhibition of cyclicAMP accumulation and lipolysis in hamster adipocytes dueto a,-catecholamine agonists, prostaglandin EP, or W-(phen-
