2579. measurement of aortic regurgitation by upstream sampling with continuousinfusion of indicatora direct and theoretically valid methodfor the measurement of aortic regurgitationinvolves the recording of indicator concentrationsfrom the left ventricle and a down-stream site during aortic root injection.  however,this method has yielded erraticresults when applied to man in the authors'laboratory when using the sudden in-jection technique.  therefore, the upstreamsampling method, using continuous in-fusion of indicator, was evaluated in 18 patientswith aortic regurgitation duringretrograde aortic and transseptal left ventricularcatheterization.  the continuousinfusion technique was compared with the techniqueof sudden injection in 10 patientsand with aortic valvulography in 14 patients.
