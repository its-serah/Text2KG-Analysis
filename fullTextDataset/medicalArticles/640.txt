Dandy-Walker syndrome (DWS) is a rare congenital malformation characterized by hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis and its upward rotation and cystic enlargement of the fourth ventricle. The clinical manifestations include psychomotor retardation, ataxia and hydrocephalus. We report a case of 16-year-old female patient in Ali Abad Teaching Hospital who was suffering from unsteady gait, memory deterioration and urinary incontinence. A brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed enlarged cystic posterior fossa, dilated fourth ventricles and upward rotated cerebellar vermis which were indicating DWS. The patient prepared for planned surgical operation and a written informed consent was obtained from her parents for surgery and general anesthesia. A cystoperitoneal (CP) shunt was placed and then the patient transferred to recovery room. After recovery and hospital stay, the patient discharged with improved clinical symptoms.
