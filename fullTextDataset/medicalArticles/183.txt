parathyroid function in chronic renal failure.  a statistical surveyof the plasma biochemistry in azotaemic renal osteodystrophy.   a collection has been made of 134 personal andpublished cases of azotemic osteodystrophy in whichadequate information was available concerning thepathological state of the bones.  measurements wereavailable of the plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, andblood-urea-nitrogen in all cases, and of plasma bicarbonateand plasma proteins in a representative sample.the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in the wholeseries of 134 cases were not related reciprocally butwere correlated directly.  these data were further analyzedby allocating each case to either of 2 sub-groups,according to the type of pathological lesions present inthe bones.
