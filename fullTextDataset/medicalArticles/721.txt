264. fluorescent antibodies to human cancer-specific dna andnuclear proteinsspecific antigens have been demonstratedin certain cancers.  in this study they wereobtained from an adenocarcinoma of thecolon and an ewing's sarcoma.  homogenateswere prepared and male rabbits wereimmunized.  the animals were bled to death10 days after the last injection.  testingincluded fluorescent antibody methods andagar-gel horizontal double-diffusion precipitintest.  the pattern of reaction of theseantibodies against various cancers seems tobe dependent upon the source of thecancerous dna-bound proteins and the saltconcentration used in their isolation.human cancer-specific cross nuclear antigensseem to be cross reacting ratherthan identical in structure.  the cancer-specificantibodies could be removed onlywith absorption of the immune globulins withcancerous tissues.
