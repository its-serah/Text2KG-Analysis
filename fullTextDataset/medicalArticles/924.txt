Growth hormone insensitivity (GHI) syndrome, first described in 1966, is classically associated with monogenic defects in the GH receptor (GHR) gene which result in severe post-natal growth failure as consequences of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) deficiency. Over the years, recognition of other monogenic defects downstream of GHR has greatly expanded understanding of primary causes of GHI and growth retardation, with either IGF-I deficiency or IGF-I insensitivity as clinical outcomes. Mutations in IGF1 and signaling component STAT5B disrupt IGF-I production, while defects in IGFALS and PAPPA2, disrupt transport and release of circulating IGF-I, respectively, affecting bioavailability of the growth-promoting IGF-I. Defects in IGF1R, cognate cell-surface receptor for IGF-I, disrupt not only IGF-I actions, but actions of the related IGF-II peptides.
