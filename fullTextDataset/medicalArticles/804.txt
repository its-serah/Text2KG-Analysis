the inhibition of cell aggregation by a pureserum proteinthe aggregation of embryonic chick and quail limb bud, heart and liver cellsin a shaker system has been investigated in order to elucidate the mechanism ofcell adhesion.a new method of assessing aggregation is described and evaluated; thismethod involved measurements of aggregation kinetics.  it was found that themeasured kinetics agree closely with flocculation kinetics, which provides adirect quantitative measurement of adhesiveness in terms of theprobability of an adhesion forming on contact between two cells.using this technique it was confirmed that aggregation is inhibited at1-2 c. in the presence of serum but not in its absence.
