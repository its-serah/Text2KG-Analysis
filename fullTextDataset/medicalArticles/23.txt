cellular proliferation and deoxyribonucleic acidsynthesis in compensating kidneys of miceand the effect of food and waterrestrictioncompensatory enlargement of the kid-ney occurred after unilateral nephrectomyin mice.  fourteen days after the removal ofone kidney the surviving renal tissue                                  6weighed 23 per cent more than single kid-neys from sham-operated animals.  thehyperplastic response of the cortex on thesecond postoperative day was 8 timesgreater than that seen in the same zone ofkidneys from sham-operated animals.  by10 days after surgery the mitotic index ofthe cortex returned to control values.  theouter medulla also underwent hyperplasiabut only on the second day followingunilateral nephrectomy was the increasesignificant.  an increase in mitotic activitywas found in the inner medulla of survivingkidneys, but it was not statistically signifi-cant.
