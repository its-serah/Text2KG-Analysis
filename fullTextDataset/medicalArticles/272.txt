insulin and protein metabolismthe present status of protein synthesis within cells hasbeen outlined.  protein is formed in the absence of insulin;the net formation of protein is accelerated by insulin.  theeffects of insulin on protein metabolism take place independentlyof the transport of glucose or amino acids into thecell; of glycogen synthesis; and of the stimulation of highenergy phosphate formation.  in the case of protein metabolism,as in certain studies on the pathways of glucose andfat metabolism, these observations reveal striking intracellulareffects of insulin in many tissues.  within mosttissues the effect of insulin appears to find expression predominantlyat the microsomal level.  incidentally, otherhormones which affect protein metabolism such as growthor sex hormones appear to act at the microsomes.
