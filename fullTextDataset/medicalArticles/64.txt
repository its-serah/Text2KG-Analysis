A study specifically looked at the anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant effects of Selenium in individuals who had
oral mucositis as a result of high-dose chemotherapy. 
According to the researchers, sufficient Selenium
supplementation might have cytoprotective and antiulcer
properties. They concluded that selenium might help 
these individuals lessen the length and severity of oral
mucositis [27].

in the increase in selenium concentration of enamel with
increasing age [28]
