use of a cross-circulation technique in studying respiratory responses  to co .                                                                   the effect of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on ventilation was           investigated in cross-circulated dogs in which the recipient dog's head and neck regions were perfused by blood from a donor dog . hypercapnia  of the donor dog was produced by administering co -o -n gas mixtures in the inspired air . hypocapnia was produced by hyperventilating the donordog with the aid of a respiratory pump . when the donor dog was         hyperventilated, the ventilation of the recipient was maintained at or  just below its resting level and it was independent of the arterial pco of the donor . the donor dog was apneic when the artificial             hyperventilation was suspended and this response was not abolished by   vagotomy .
