Anticoagulants are used to prevent clot formation both in vitro and in vivo. In the specific field of in vitro diagnostics, anticoagulants are commonly added to collection tubes either to maintain blood in the fluid state for hematological testing or to obtain suitable plasma for coagulation and clinical chemistry analyses. Unfortunately, no universal anticoagulant that could be used for evaluation of several laboratory parameters in a sample from a single test tube is available so far. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a polyprotic acid containing four carboxylic acid groups and two amine groups with lone-pair electrons that chelate calcium and several other metal ions.Â
