Neonatal jaundice (NNJ) is common in sub‚ÄêSaharan Africa (SSA), and it is associated with sepsis. Despite the high incidence, little has been documented about developmental impairments associated with NNJ in SSA. In particular, it is not clear if sepsis is associated with greater impairment following NNJ.We followed up 169 participants aged 12 months (57 cases and 112 controls) within the Kilifi Health Demographic Surveillance System. The diagnosis of NNJ was based on clinical laboratory measurement of total serum bilirubin on admission, whereas the developmental outcomes were assessed using the Developmental Milestones Checklist and Kilifi Development Inventory.
