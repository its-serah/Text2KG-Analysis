1163. the effect of glucose infusions on the lipoid and thecarbohydrate metabolism of the parturient woman andthe fetusin 20 parturient women who were given glucoseinfusions during the expulsive stageof labor, the authors were able to observe an unusualhyperglycemia and a decreasein unesterified fatty acids (uefa).  the uefa-levelusually increases regularlyduring delivery.  likewise, the values of esterifiedfatty acids (efa) showed an in-crease above the normally present levels in womenwho had received a glucose in-fusion during the expulsive stage of labor.  theresults show that during deliveryboth hyperglycemia and the increase in lipoidsare predominantly due to the energydemands of the organism.  however, there is alsoevidence that other, hitherto un-known factors may play a role.
