the effect of actinomycin d on parathyroid-inducedchange in bone and kidney.actinomycin d (amd), an antibiotic known toinhibit dna-directed rna synthesis,was used to study parathyroid-induced changesin ca mobilization in vivo and in vitroas well as renal excretion of ca and phosphatein rats.  intact and parathyroidectomizedrats subjected to peritoneal lavage wereadministered amd, and changes inca, p, and mg in lavage and serum wereexamined.  amd consistently lowered theca transfer into the peritoneal rinse in boththe intact and parathyroidectomized animals,although the drop in ca was more acuteif the animals were pretreated by subcutaneousinjections of amd than if amd wasadministered as a component of therinse.
