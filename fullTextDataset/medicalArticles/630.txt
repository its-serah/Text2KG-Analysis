specific carcinoembryonic antigens of the human digestive system .        a wide variety of human adult and fetal tissues were studied by       immunodiffusion techniques in agar gel to determine whether they        contained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in colonic     cancers . in the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identical       antigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of theentodermally derived epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract and      pancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues . the     common antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specific     cancer antigens of the human digestive system . system-specific cancer  antigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans .              .
