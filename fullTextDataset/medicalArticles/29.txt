antidiuretic properties of chlorothiazidein diabetes insipidus dogschlorothiazide was found to decreaseurine volume and increase urine con-centration in diabetes insipidus dogs.there was no change in gfr, rpf,tmpah, plasma volume, extracellularfluid or total body water.  the one con-sistent altered function was a decreasein "free water" clearance.  diazoxide andmercuhydrin were not antidiuretic.  it isbelieved that the antidiuretic action isdependent on the chlorothiazide-inducedsaluresis.  although the mechanism ofthis antidiuresis has not been clearly de-fined, it seems best explained by postu-lating a decrease in filtrate reaching thedistal nephron (giving a decreased finalurine volume) coupled with inhibition ofsolute reabsorption in the distal tubule(preventing the selective reabsorption ofsolute in the distal tubule that is nor-mally seen, accounting for the increasein urine concentration).
