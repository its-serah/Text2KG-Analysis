mitotic lymphocytes in primary tissue cultures of normal and neoplastic human lung .                                                              normal and tumor tissue explants from 33 resected human lungs were    studied in vitro . lymphocyte mitoses were observed in tissue cultures  derived from 12 of the lungs . the ability of lymphocytes to undergo    mitotic division in human lung tissue culture has not been reported     previously . in the autologous systems used lymphocyte mitoses were muchmore common in cellular outgrowths derived from non-neoplastic tissue   than they were in the outgrowths derived from cancer-bearing explants . no differences were observed in the total number of nondividing         lymphocytes present in the non-neoplastic and neoplastic preparations . the in ritro systems employed are promising tools for further           contributions to an already well established clinicopathologic          relationship between lymphocytes and cancer cells .
