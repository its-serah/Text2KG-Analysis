744. studies on protein and nucleic acid metabolism in virus-in-fected mammalian cells.  the formation of a virus-specificantigen in krebs ii ascites-tumour cells infected with ence-phalomyocarditis viruskrebs ii mouse ascites-tumor cells infectedwith encephalomyocarditis virus werefound to contain, in addition to mature virus,a virus-specific protein antigen.  anassay, based on the ability of this antigento block the neutralization of purified virusby its specific antiserum, was developed.this antigen was present both in the cul-ture fluid 17 hr. after the infection of cellswith virus and intracellularly, where itstiter increased at a time when viral capsidprotein was being synthesized.
