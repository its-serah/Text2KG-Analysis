in the test to see the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids byvarious organs, a marked uptake has been observed in spleen, bone       marrow, and liver of both irradiated and non-irradiated groups .        further, the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids in the rabbits given  intravenous injections of compound lipid fraction for 30 consecutive    days previously has been found to be greatest in pancreas followed by   bone marrow, spleen, liver in the order mentioned in male group, whereasit is greatest in spleen, followed by liver and bone marrow in the      female group .                                                            with these results the discussion was conducted concerning the        relation between the lipid metabolism and x-ray disturbances .
