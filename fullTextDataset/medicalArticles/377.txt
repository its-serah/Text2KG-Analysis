studies on growth hormone secretionin rats with the hypophysis autotransplantedto the kidney capsulethe secretory capacity of the pituitary gland, autotransplanted to thekidney capsule, was studied with special regard to the secretion of growthhormone (gh).  body weight, body length, tibial epiphyseal width andthe mammary gland development after testosterone stimulation werestudied.body growth and tibial epiphyseal width were markedly reduced in therats with transplanted hypophysis, but not as much as in the hypophys-ectomized controls.  after injections of 0.25 mg testosterone propionatedaily for 10 days, only a few groups of alveoli were seen in the mam-mary glands of the transplanted rats.  these observations show that thereis a considerable deficiency of gh in rats with the pituitary gland auto-transplanted to the kidney capsule.
