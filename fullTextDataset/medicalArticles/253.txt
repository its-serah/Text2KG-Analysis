some observations on the effects in vivo of varying ambient temperatureson filarial worms of snakes.new information was obtained on the biologyof filarial worms from experimentsusing constrictor constrictor mexicanusboas, infected with macdonaldius oscheiworms.  the microfilariae of m. oschei areaperiodic with respect to the light cycle,but fluctuate sharply in density from dayto day.  maximum minimum levels occurapprox. 2 days apart.  the microfilariaeare larger and more variable in size onthe days of maximum density than on thedays of minimum density.  it is suggestedthat the smaller microfilariae on the daysof low parasitemia are those that havebeen born recently and that they enlargeduring the following 48 hr. before they enterthe peripheral capillaries.
