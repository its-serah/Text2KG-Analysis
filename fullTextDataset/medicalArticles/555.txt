infectivity of dna isolated from bacillus subtilis bacteriophage, sp82 .  sp82, a newly isolated bacteriophage of bacillus subtilis, is         described . sp82 is closely related to sp8, but differs from sp8 in the density of its denatured dna and in its plating effciency on b. subtilisstrain sb-1 .                                                             dna isolated from this phage can be recovered in molecular weight     equivalent to the amount contained in a single phage (approximately 130 x 10 daltons) . dna of this molecular weight, but not half pieces, is   infective in competent b. subtilis . the response of plaque-forming     ability to dna concentration suggests that four whole molecules are     required to initiate an infective center . recombination studies with   mixed dna's of two non-allelic temperature-sensitive mutants confirm theexistence of an obligatory co-operative infective process . a second    infective procedure that utilizes extracted phage dna is described . in this system, low concentrations of wild-type dna are exposed to the     cells .
