infantile autism: a family approachthe autistic child appears to be unable to integrate or to respond tostimuli, both from an internal source, the body, as well as from externalsources, such as human contact.  we have noted in the children at ourresidential treatment center how in their preliminary period with us theyappear to be unaware of their body; they give the impression of beinginsensitive to pain, display little autoerotic behavior, inflict injury onthemselves, such as hitting their heads against objects and biting their ownbodies, with little outward display of distress.  in working with thesechildren in therapy, one of the guideposts for change and for growth is adisplay on the child's part of an increased body awareness and autoeroticbehavior.
