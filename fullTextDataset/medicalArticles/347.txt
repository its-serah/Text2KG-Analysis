selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.  with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially prepared   antisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined .    individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrin clearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecular       weights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically,   its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and the    slope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be saidto express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion .  sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfying the usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome .
