effect of heterologous antiserum and complement on glycolysis of tumor  cells .                                                                   the effect of heterologous antiserum and complement on glucose        metabolism of rat ascites tumor cells was examined to clarify the       mechanism of the cytotoxic effect of antibody .                           1. lactate-production of the target cells was inhibited by the        cooperation of antiserum and complement, while no inhibition was        observed when the cells were subjected to either antiserum or complementalone . the inhibition of lactate-production was observed under both    acrobic and anacrobic conditions . no effect of the antiserum and       complement was observed on the oxygen consumption of the cells .
