tissue distribution of electrolytes, ca and mg in experimentalhyper- and hypoparathyroidism.the effects of experimental hyper- andhypoparathyroidism on plasma and tissuedistribution of electrolytes and tissueexchangeability with ca and mg were studiedin dogs following acute renal pedicleligation.  in hyperparathyroidism, plasma concentrationsof mg and inorganic p aswell as ca were increased.  a greater accumulationof ca occurred in some tissuesand a lesser accumulation in others thanin acute hypercalcemia of comparableseverity and the fractional rate of exchangeof tissue ca was 30% more rapid thanin control and acute hypercalcemic dogs.bone exchange of ca was not significantlyincreased.
