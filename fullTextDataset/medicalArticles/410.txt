The first known reports of "water" around the brain of macrocephalic children comes from Hippocrates, although the term "hydrocephalus" was not coined until the writings of Celsus sometime between 25 BC to 50 AD [1,Â 2]. Though little was initially known about the anatomy and physiology of this captivating problem, anatomists like Galen and Antyllus attempted the earliest surgery with expectedly poor outcomes [1]. Further elucidation of the condition came more recently from the early modern era of seventeenth century anatomists, such as Willis, Monroe, Magendie and Luschka who, among others, began to unravel the architecture of the ventricular spaces and passageways within the brain [1]. The addition of experimentation with material science in the 1800s and early 1900s paired with the Walter Dandy dog model of obstructive hydrocephalus using injection of phenolsulfonphthalein led to our modern understanding of communicating versus non-communicating hydrocephalus [3].
