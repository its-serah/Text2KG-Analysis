A myriad of destructive processes unfold in injured tissue following ischemia-reperfusion. These include excitotoxicty, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, free radical production, seizure activity, blood-brain barrier disruption, blood vessel leakage, cerebral thermopooling, and numerous others. The severity of this destructive cascade determines whether injured cells will survive or die. Hypothermia can inhibit or mitigate all of these mechanisms, while stimulating protective systems such as early gene activation. Hypothermia is also effective in mitigating intracranial hypertension and reducing brain edema. Side effects include immunosuppression with increased infection risk, cold diuresis and hypovolemia, electrolyte disorders, insulin resistance, impaired drug clearance, and mild coagulopathy.Â
