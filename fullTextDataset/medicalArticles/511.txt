i. urinary excretion of neutral 17-ketosteroids and pregnanediol by     patients with breast cancer and benign breast disease .                   urinary levels of neutral 17-ketosteroid fractions and pregnanediol   excreted by 114 women, 56 premenopausal and 58 postmenopausal, were     determined . subjects studied were included in 4 premenopausal groups   (breast cancer 6, benign breast disease 18, sick control 8, well control24) and 3 postmenopausal groups (breast cancer 21, sick control 17, wellcontrol 20) .                                                             levels of androsterone and etiocholanolone excreted by premenopausal  patients with breast cancer were significantly less than levels excretedby other premenopausal groups, and they did not differ significantly    from levels excreted by postmenopausal patients with breast cancer .
