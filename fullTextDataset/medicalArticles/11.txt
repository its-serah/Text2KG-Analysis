growth hormonegrowth hormone influences protein, fat,carbohydrate, and mineral metabolism.  itpromotes nitrogen retention, growth ofcartilage, transportation of amino acidsthrough the cell wall, and incorporation ofamino acids into protein.  this factor mo-bilizes free fatty acids from adipose tissueand increases the serum concentration ofthese substances; long-term administrationof this hormone is followed by depletion ofbody fat stores and inhibition of fatty acidsynthesis.  in diabetic subjects growth hor-mone administration is followed by hyper-glycemia, glycosuria, and ketosis; its effecton carbohydrate metabolism in normal sub-jects is more subtle.  sodium, potassium, andinorganic phosphate are retained followingthe administration of growth hormone.hypercalciuria also accompanies such treat-ment, an effect mediated through the para-thyroid glands.
