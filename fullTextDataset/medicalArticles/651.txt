Primary hyperparathyroidism is a relatively common problem encountered by the endocrine surgeon. Most patients present with asymptomatic 1 or incidental disease. Parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice with a cure rate of 96–98% in expert centres. 2 A common cause of failure is inadequate resection of the parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia and an ectopic location of the parathyroid gland. Most ectopic glands are found in the superior mediastinum in the thymus gland and can be excised via a cervical incision. However, parathyroid adenomas found deeper in the mediastinum remain a challenge.
