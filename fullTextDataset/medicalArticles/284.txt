comparison of ultraviolet sensitivity of bacillus subtilis bacteriophagespo2 and its infectious dna .                                             deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from a clear plaque mutant of the     temperate phage, spo2, was infectious when incubated with competent     cultures of bacillus subtilis 168 m . the relationship between numbers  of infectious centers and dna concentration was linear .                  the sensitivity of the infectious dna to ultraviolet light was much   greater than that of the free phage when b. subtilis 168 m was used as  host . acriflavin, which inhibits host cell reactivation, increased the rate of ultraviolet inactivation of the free phage so that it approachedthe inactivation rate of the phage dna . acriflavin had little effect onthe survival curves of the infectious dna .                               non-host reactivating mutants (hcr ) of b. subtilis 168 m were        isolated .
