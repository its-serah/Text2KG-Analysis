human growth hormoneclinical measurement, response to hypoglycemia and suppression bycorticosteroidsa standard test of growth-hormone secretory ca-pacity, based on radioimmunoassay of plasma growthhormone after insulin hypoglycemia, is described.  innormal subjects a standard insulin tolerance test, caus-ing an average blood glucose drop to 34 per cent ofresting values, produced a mean rise in growth hor-mone to 45.2 millimicrogm. per milliliter at one hour,with a total range of 25 to 70 millimicrogm. per mil-liliter.  no response was observed in 5 hypopituitarysubjects.
