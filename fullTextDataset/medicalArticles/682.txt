hormone therapy in metastatic breast cancer.. clinical response and     urinary gonadotrophins .                                                  the total urinary gonadotrophin output of a group of post menopausal  women with metastatic breast carcinoma undergoing hormone therapy, whichin every case initially consisted of treatment with diethylstilboestrol,des (ca. 20 mg/d), has been studied for periods varying from seven      months to 31/2 years .                                                    no correlation between gonadotrophin output and clinical response was found, except that in all cases showing objective regression urinary    gonadotrophin remained low throughout the remission period . a low levelof gonadotrophin output was not, however, necessarily indicative of a   good clinical remission . following withdrawal of des, and independent  of the period of therapy, recovery to pre-treatment levels was the rule rather than the exception .
