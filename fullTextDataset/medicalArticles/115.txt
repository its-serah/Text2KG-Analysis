the serological differentiation of mycoplasma strains (pleuro-pneumonia-like organisms) from various sourcesa complement fixation test with rabbit antisera was used to differentiate 82cultures of mycoplasma from man, mammalian cell cultures, laboratory rats andmice, cattle, goats, poultry, embryonated eggs and sewage.seventeen serotypes were distinguished, 5 from man, 1 from mammalian cellcultures, 4 from rats and mice, 4 from cattle and goats, 2 from poultry and onesaprophytic.  most of these corresponded to recognized species of mycoplasma,but 1 of human origin (represented by 1 strain, navel), and 1 from tissuecultures (5 strains), may represent new species.  r38, one of the serotypesfrom rats, could be distinguished from the species m. arthritidis, but isprobably an antigenic variant rather than a distinct species.
