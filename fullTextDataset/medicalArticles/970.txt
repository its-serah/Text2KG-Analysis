Mycoplasma pneumonia is a common respiratory pathogen that produces diseases of varied severity ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe atypical pneumonia. Although rarely fatal, M. pneumoniae is an important cause of acute respiratory tract infection, especially as a potential etiology of the clinical entity termed "atypical pneumonia". Initially it was known as Eaton agent, after Eaton et al, identified this plero-pulmonary like organisms from the sputum of patients with primary atypical pneumonia in 1944. It subsequently renamed as Mycoplasma.
