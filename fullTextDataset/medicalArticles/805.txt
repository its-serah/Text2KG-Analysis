2344. respiratory and cardiovascular changes during rapid spon-taneous variations of ventricular fluid pressure in pa-tients with intracranial hypertensionin patients with intracranial hypertensionthe ventricular fluid pressure (vfp)curve is characterized by 3 main formsof spontaneous variations. Â two of theseforms are of a rhythmical nature, andare here called 1-per-minute waves and 6-per-minute waves, respectively, inaccordance with the dominating frequency.the third form - irregularly appearingwaves of large amplitude and duration -is called plateau waves in accordancewith the usual shape of the fluctuations.respiratory and cardio-vascular changesaccompanying these variations of the vfpwere studied by simultaneous recording,in various combinations, of the vfp, thepulmonary ventilation, the pco2 of theexpiratory air,
