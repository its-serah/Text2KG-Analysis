We present a 61-year-old African American male patient with a history of right cervical internal carotid artery dissection that was treated with carotid artery stenting and endovascular thrombectomy, who developed recurrent right hemispheric infarcts related to delayed carotid stent thrombosis. Digital subtraction angiography found multiple filling defects consistent with extensive in-stent thrombosis not clearly observed with magnetic resonance angiography. Etiology was likely secondary to chronic antiplatelet noncompliance. Therefore, the patient was treated medically with a heparin drip, and dual antiplatelet therapyÂ (dAPT) was restarted. At 1-month follow-up the patient did not report new motor or sensory deficits.
