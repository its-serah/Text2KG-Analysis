3083. myocardial toxicity of contrast agents used in angiographythe myocardial toxicity of many current andsome experimental contrast agentshas been studied in dogs, by use of a previouslyunreported method of occlusionretrograde coronary venography as well as thefamiliar technique of selectivecoronary arterial catheterization.  the followingconclusions appear justified inthe light of the experiments   not only theiodine-containing radicals with which thecontrast agents are so often identified (acetrizoates,diatrizoates, iothalamates,etc.), but also the final salification products appearto be responsible for the widelydivergent degrees of myocardial toxicity of contrastagents, to the point that differ-ent salts of the same compound behave as entirelydifferent agents both chemicallyand biologically.  the results seem to indicate thedominance of sodium ion and/orthe protective effect of methylglucamine salts withrespect to the myocardial toxi-city of current radiopaque media.
