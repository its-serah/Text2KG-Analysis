Hypercalcemia is defined as serum calcium concentration two standard deviations above the mean, or simply stated, serum calcium levels of more than 10.5 mg/dl.1,2 Hypercalcemia is an uncommon occurrence in urological malignancies except for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, when seen, it is usually associated with advanced disease and both the osteolytic as well as humoral mechanisms may be causative. Owing to its rarity, hypercalcemia can be easily missed during the initial evaluation of a patient with urologic malignancy.We hereby discuss hypercalcemia and its mechanisms of action and also enlist a Â­comprehensive review of the literature in hypercalcemia in individual urological malignancies.
