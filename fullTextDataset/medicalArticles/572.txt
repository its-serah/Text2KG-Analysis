comparative bone marrow study using two aspiration needles and two      biopsy sites .                                                            bone marrow aspiration is now widely used in the diagnosis of         hematologic diseases and many conditions not primarily affecting the    blood system . a number of techniques have been devised by which a      suitable specimen of marrow can be obtained with relatively little      discomfort to the patient . the two needle sets described in this paper have been found to be equally reliable in obtaining bone marrow for     microscopic study and diagnosis . comparative studies of bone marrow    aspirated simultaneously from the iliac crest and the sternum in 26     patients show no significant difference . however, there were four      instances of dry tap at the iliac site .
