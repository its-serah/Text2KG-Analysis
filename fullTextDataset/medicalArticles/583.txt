responses of b. subtilis (atcc 558) to streptomycin .                     to observe in detail the influence of streptomycin on the growth of smdependent type, the author chose b. subtilis (atcc 558) and made        experiments on its responses to streptomycin, with special reference to the relation of the sm concentration with spore formation of its sm     dependent type together with germination and outgrowth of the spores    formed . the results are as follows .                                     1. among 18x10 cells of wild type of b. subtilis (atcc 558) about     3,200 cells of sm resistant and one cell of sm dependent are found as   its mutant .                                                              2. b. substilis (atcc 558) shows normal growth at sm concentration    below 10 r/ml, but the growth declines rapidly between sm 10 r/ml-20 r/ml, and the growth stops entirely at sm concentration 20 r/ml .
