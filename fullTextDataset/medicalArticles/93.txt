3230. cerebral hemodynamics, blood gases, and electrolytesduring breath-holding and the valsalva maneuvercontinuous recordings of arterial andinternal jugular blood oxygen tension, oxy-gen saturation, carbon dioxide tension,ph, sodium and potassium, together withpeco2, blood pressure, andelectroencephalogram were obtained to compare theeffects of inspiratory and expiratorybreath-holding and the valsalva maneuver onthe cerebral circulation and cerebraloxygen availability in man. Â during the inter-val of tolerated breath-holding for69 seconds or less, jugular venous oxygen tensionwas increased owing to increasedcerebral blood flow resulting from an increaseof arterial carbon dioxide tension.
