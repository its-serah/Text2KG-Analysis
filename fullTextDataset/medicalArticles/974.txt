The adrenal glands synthesize and secrete steroid hormones that are effectors of adaptive responses to oscillations in the organism's internal and external environment, broadly referred as stress. Adrenal steroid hormones serve to modulate a wide range of processes that are central to physiologic responses to stress, including energy metabolism, immune response, electrolyte homeostasis, and fluid balance [1]. To fulfill these tasks, the adrenal cortex is organized into functionally and histologically distinct zones: the outermost zona glomerulosa (ZG), the intermediate zona fasciculata (ZF), and the innermost zona reticularis (ZR), which are responsible for the production of mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens, respectively [2,Â 3].
