These studies are, however, all confounded by the uncertaineffect of total body irradiation conditioning on AM turnoveritself. While initially thought to be relatively radiation resistant,other studies indicate that the AM is sensitive to the level ofradiation that accompanies transplant conditioning regimens (12,13). Rather than identifying their intrinsic half-life, studies intransplant chimeras may, thus, be primarily measuring the rate ofAM repopulation by the bone marrow in the setting of a toxicexposure. To more precisely determine AM half-life, we generated bone marrow chimeras in irradiated mice in which theirthorax was, and was not, shielded with lead during transplantation. Using this method, we found that the half-life of AM is infact much longer than previously reported.
