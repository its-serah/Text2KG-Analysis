evidence for an immunological reaction of the host directed against its own actively growing primary tumor .                                      cells isolated from primary benzo(a)pyrene-induced fibrosarcomas in   rats of a pure line were tested for their ability to grow as autografts when injected back into the autochthonous host . the autograft did not  take if the primary tumor had been removed but grew occasionally in     animals in which the major part of the tumor was left . in every        instance the sarcoma cells grew when injected into syngeneic recipients in these recipients the growth of the sarcoma cells was prevented or  retarded when they were mixed in vitro, prior to injection, with spleen cells from animals that had been immunized against the tumor .          autochthonous spleen cells taken from the animal with the tumor behaved in this test like those from immunized animals as long as the spleen wastaken 3 weeks after removal of the tumor . when the spleen and tumor    were removed at the same time.
