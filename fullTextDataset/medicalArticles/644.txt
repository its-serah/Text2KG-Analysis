measurement of pericardial fluid correlated with the i -cholografin and ihsa heart scan .                                                         in 23 patients undergoing open-heart surgery in whom the pericardial  contents were accurately measured, and in 11 additional patients        examined at autopsy or by pericardiocentesis, isotopic photoscans of theheart were made and the results were correlated .                         the most accurate means of diagnosis of pericardial effusion was foundto be the ratio of the maximum transverse cardiac diameters on scan and roentgenogram . in patients with less than 100 cc of pericardial fluid  this ratio was greater than 0.80, and it was less than this in cases of effusion of 200 cc or more .
