1689. alterations in pulmonary surface active lipids during ex-posure to increased oxygen tensionthe syndrome of progressive respiratorydistress, pulmonary edema, and increasedpulmonary surface tension was induced in8 dogs by exposure to oxygen tensionsgreater than 550 mm hg for 44.5 and 52hours.  pulmonary surfactant was extractedby endobronchial washing for measurementof lipid composition and surface activity.five dogs developed respiratory distresswithout pulmonary edema.  in these dogsendobronchial wash surface tension wasnormal or slightly increased, and totallipid distribution was essentially normal.esterified fatty acids in the lecithin frac-tion were consistently altered with areduction in palmitate and total saturated fattyacids.  three dogs developed pulmonaryedema with increased surface tension, in-creased total lipid and protein, andrelatively decreased total phospholipid in theendobronchial washings.
