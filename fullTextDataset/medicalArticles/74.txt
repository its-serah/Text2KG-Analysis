factors influencing development of tumors in frogs .                      (1) study of 75 spontaneous tumors of vermont frogs showed three      pathological grades of malignancy present.. aggressive renal            adenocarcinoma in some 30 per cent, medium adenocarcinoma in 50 per     cent, and lower grade mixed with tumors of undetermined origin in the   remaining 20 per cent .                                                   (2) correlation with parasite infections (trematodes) was demonstrablein only few cases in the kidney . hyperplasias and neoplasias grading   into lung primary carcinoma have been found in the lung in r. pipiens . temperatures below 15 c. protected animals from lung as well as kidney  disease . higher temperatures disturbed the host-parasite relationships and led to higher incidence of malignancy . in the bullfrog, precancer  was clearly associated with the worm attachment discs .                   (3) other histological types of tumors in vermont frogs included      lymphosarcomas, liposarcoma, mesothelioma, epithelioma, and adrenal and cartilage tumors of uncertain malignancy .
