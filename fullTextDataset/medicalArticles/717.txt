Alveolar macrophages (AMs), which were first established tooriginate from the bone marrow in 1968, serve as the first line ofdefense against inhaled pathogens, and function as a reservoirfor chronic pathogens such as HIV and Tb (1–5). Since thesecells are central to the lung’s innate immune system, historicallythere has been considerable interest in understanding basicelements of AM biology, including intrinsic half-life.To date, AM half-life estimations have been based largely onmeasurements of alveolar macrophage turnover in chimeric micegenerated through irradiation conditioning regimens and bonemarrow transplantation. Using such techniques, a large body ofwork has established a half-life of between 10 and 30 days forthe murine AM (6–11).
