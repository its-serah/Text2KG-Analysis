In the absence of conclusive data on levels of nickel that will induce sensitisation thatthe existing nickel release requirement of 0.5 µg/cm²/week for articles in prolongedcontact with the skin should form the basis of a nickel release requirement for postassemblies. Given the existing methodology EN 1811 uses artificial sweat, anadjustment in the limit should be made to account for increased rate of nickel releaseinto blood plasma and the limit should be reduced accordingly. Therefore it has beenEC Contract: ETD/FIF.2001592 2recommended that the existing requirement in the Nickel Directive for a maximumnickel content of 0.05% m/m in post assemblies as described is replaced by a nickelmigration limit for all post assemblies of 0.2 µg/cm2/week using the methodologyspecified in EN 1811.
