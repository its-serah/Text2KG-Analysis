BODY COMPOSITION CHANGES it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations.
FETAL FAT ACCUMULATION the hypothesis is presented that the maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat accumulation.
UNINJECTED MOTHERS the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers.
BODY FAT the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers.
