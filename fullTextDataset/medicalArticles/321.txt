903. lattice structures and osmiophilic bodies in the developingrespiratory tissue of ratsosmiophilic inclusions have been observed in thelungs of rats particularly in the 20-day rat embryo andnewborn up to 3 days post partum.  these inclusionsare present in the large alveolar cells as dense lamin-ated structures of variable size and configuration.  theygenerally consist of concentrically arranged membranesand have the appearance of myelin figures, usually witha dense center.  these osmiophilic inclusions are fre-quently seen in direct contact with the cell membranesand the alveolar space.  the alveolar space containsnumerous osmiophilic myelin figures which are thoughtto originate from the intracellular osmiophilic inclu-sions.
