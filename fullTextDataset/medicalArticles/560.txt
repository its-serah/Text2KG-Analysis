effects of short term administration ofhysiological doses of human growth hormonein three patients with turner's syndromeh. e. sjobergthe effect of apparently physiological doses of human growth hormonewas investigated in three patients with turner's syndrome in short termmetabolic balance studies.  the subjects presented an abnormal sex chro-mosome constitution and an increased level of sulphation factor activityin serum.two dose levels of hormone were used, and there appeared an anabolicresponse to both.  no correlation with dose was obtained for any of theparameters used except for urinary magnesium, where the retention wasgreater with the higher dose.  the sulphation factor activity of serum in-creased during hormone administration in the one case studied in thisrespect.
