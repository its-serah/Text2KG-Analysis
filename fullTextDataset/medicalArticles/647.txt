Carotid stent thrombosis is an exceptionally rare and potentially fatal complication after carotid artery stenting (CAS), with limited reporting in the acute setting that usually manifests as a stroke secondary to thromboembolic mechanism [1]. This complication can be suspected with the worsening of neurologic deficit and a history of medication noncompliance. The scarcity of literature regarding carotid stent thrombosis is even more pronounced in the delayed setting. Furthermore, there is currently no established definition regarding the timeframe to distinguish delayed carotid stent thrombosis (dCSTh) from acute or subacute carotid stent thrombosis.Â
