effects of aortic regurgitation on left ventricular performance direct  determinations of aortic blood flow before and after valve replacement .  the volume of regurgitant blood flow and its effects on the           performance of the left ventricle were assessed at operation in 14      patients with varying degrees of aortic regurgitation . instantaneous   forward and regurgitant flows in the ascending aorta were measured with a sine-wave electromagnetic flowmeter simultaneously with left          ventricular and aortic pressures . in eight patients who had aortic     regurgitation without associated stenosis, 63 to 75 percent of the totalforward stroke volume regurgitated during the succeeding diastole . the calculated regurgitant orifice areas ranged from 0.13 to 0.44 cm /m .
