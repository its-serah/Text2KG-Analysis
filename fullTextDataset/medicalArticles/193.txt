 7. micropinocytotic vesicles are present in large numbers in both     epithelial and endothelial cytoplasm and it is suggested that in the    foetus they may indicate absorption of amniotic fluid from alveolar     spaces .                                                                  8. the mechanism of alveolar distension is discussed and its nature   remains uncertain .                                                       9. respiratory tissue of the rat is not fully differentiated at birth and the importance of this fact in human infants is discussed .           10. the adult blood-air barrier, consisting of epithelium, zona       diffusa and endothelium, varies in thickness .                            this project was performed whilst both of us were in receipt of grantsfrom the medical research council of canada, for which gratitude is     expressed . our gratitude is also expressed to miss sylvia smith for    typing the manuscript .
