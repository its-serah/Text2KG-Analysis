experimental studies on cerebrospinalfluid flowa mixed suspension of kaolin and lyco-podium was injected into the cisterna magnaof dogs.  blockade of csf space was producedsuccessfully in 63 of 75 dogs; in 48 of the 63,ventricular dilatation of more than interme-diate degree was observed.in these hydrocephalic dogs experimentalshunting was performed either between thelateral ventricle and the lumbar cistern or be-tween the unilateral lateral ventricle and thecontralateral cerebral subarachnoid space.  uni-directional, steady csf flow averaged 0.15 ml. perhour in the cases of the former shunting,and the flow averaged 0.25 ml. per hour in thecases of the latter shunting.
