3446. effect of nicl2 on an isolated ranvier nodean attempt was made to explain the extreme prolongation of the nodalpotential by 0.1-1.0 mm nicl2 in terms of the ionic theory.  the effects ofnicl2 at room temperature are similar to those of temperature reductiondecreased maximum rate of rise of the action potential, lengthened actionpotential duration, elevated threshold, increased tendency for repetitiveactivity; in addition, the amplitude of the action potential is slightlyincreased.  the long-lasting plateaus of the responses obtained under thecombined influence of nicl2 and temperature reduction are shortened by cathodalpolarization, strong anodal polarization and decrease of (na)0.
