12083. generation of action potentials in single ranvier's nodes of isolatedfrog nerve fibres under the influence of nickel and cadmium ions (russian)by experimenting on single ranvier's nodes of frog isolated nerve fibres itwas shown that, along with a marked prolongation of the repolarizationphase of the action potential (ap), ni and cd ions also caused a rise ofthe critical membrane depolarization level and an increased ap amplitudewith somewhat reduced steepness of its ascending phase.  ni and cd ionsrestored the ap generation in the nodes of ranvier altered by a 0.01% procainesolution, by an excess of potassium ions 00mm/1. of kcl) or by slightmechanical injury during dissection.
