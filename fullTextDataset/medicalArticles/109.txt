(i) general anxiety and regression, (ii) separation anxiety, (iii) anxiety about sleep, (iv)    eating disturbance, (v) aggression toward authority, and (vi)           apathy-withdrawal . scores for these six factors (types of responses) aswell as a total score, were analyzed by univariate and, in most cases,  multivariate analyses of variance . four variables -dash sex, prior     hospitalization, degree of pain experienced during hospitalization, and birth order -dash were essentially unrelated to any type of response by any analysis .
