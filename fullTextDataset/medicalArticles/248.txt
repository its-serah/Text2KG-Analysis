Maternal infection with the intracellular protozoan parasite is usually acquired by contact with the oocytes excreted in cat feces or ingestion of inadequately cooked meat. The infectious agent crosses the placenta best during the third trimester.[3] However, those infected earlier in pregnancy have more severe disease. A majority of the recorded cases of congenital toxoplasmosis have shown either clinical evidence of damage to the central nervous system at birth or have developed such signs after the first few weeks of life. Most infants with congenital toxoplasmosis have hepatosplenomegaly, but jaundice may be variable. Presentation as isolated neonatal hepatitis has not been reported earlier. We present a child with neonatal hepatitis and congenital toxoplasmosis.
