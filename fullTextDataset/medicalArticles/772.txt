studies on the compound lipids from x-ray irradiated animal, ii.        biological and biochemical properties of the compound lipids in the     x-ray irradiated rabbit organs .                                          for the purpose to clarify the causes of x-ray disturbances a series  of experiments have been conducted on biological and biochemical        properties of compound lipids extracted from normal and x-ray irradiatedrabbit organs with a special reference to the p -labeled compound lipidsuptake, inhibitory action to l cell proliferation and uncoupling of     oxidative phosphorylation, and the following results have been obtained the compound lipids (lysophosphatide rich fraction) isolated from the x-ray irradiated rabbit organ have been found to possess a strong       hemolytic action and also an action to inhibit the cell proliferation aswell as to accelerate the respiration of the mitochondria in the rabbit liver and spleen .
