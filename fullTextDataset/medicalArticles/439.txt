1021. left ventricular angiocardiography in the study of ventricularseptal defectssixty-five cases of ventricular septal defectwere studied by left angiocardiography.the left ventricle was entered by retrogradearterial catheterization with a catheterhaving a j-shaped tip.  this procedure appearsto be little, or no more, hazardousthan right-sided angiocardiography.  ventricularseptal defects may be divided into5 types, depending on their location in the ventricularseptum.  the anatomic andradiological features of the septum and septal defectsare described.  selective in-jection of contrast material into the left ventricleopacifies the blood passing throughthe defect in the septum and permits preoperativelocalization of the defect in rela-tion to identifiable anatomic landmarks.  multipledefects of the septum are well de-monstrated.
