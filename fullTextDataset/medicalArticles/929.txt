electron microscopy of cytoplasmic inclusions within /macrophages/ of   human tissue .                                                            the fine structure of inclusions found within the cytoplasm of        macrophages of human lung, spleen, skin, lymph node, and rectum has beendescribed .                                                               the inclusions appear as concentric or whorled lamellae arranged      around a core . each lamella is constructed of discrete, parallel       filaments . the inclusions do not resemble currently described viruses  or virus-like particles, nor do they resemble asbestos bodies or other  known atmospheric pollutants or ingestants .                              there is some resemblance to lipid phase systems as well as mast cell granules,. possibly the inclusions represent partial intracellular      digestion of phagocytized tissue membranes or ingested mast cell        granules, respectively .
