Although fluoropyrimidine-associated cardiotoxicity was first observed as early as the 1960s, there have been few clinical trials focused specifically on defining the incidence of cardiotoxicity, which is thought to range from 1% to 19%.14 In general, reported incidence data have been based largely on retrospective studies that lack consistent definitions of cardiotoxicity and have variable reporting of cardiac events. In a prospective surveillance study of patients treated with 5-FU, 19 of 102 patients developed angina within 24 hours of 5-FU initiation.14 These patients did not have previously diagnosed coronary disease, and subsequent coronary angiography showed minimal disease. Associated electrocardiographic changes, such as ST depression or ST elevation, resolved with the resolution of chest pain over a 2- to 12-hour period after drug cessation. Two patients demonstrated a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiogram compared with a recent baseline.
