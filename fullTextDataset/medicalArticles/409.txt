an electron microscopic study of wolffian lens regeneration in the adultnewt .                                                                    changes in the morphology of cells during the regenerative tissue     transformation of the pigmented epithelium of the iris into lens in the adult newt triturus viridescens were studied in ultrathin sections usingthe electron microscope . in addition, quantitative analyses with       electron micrographs were performed . the cells of the normal iris are  characterized by an abundance of melanin granules, an extensive smooth--surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, and irregular indentations of the       nuclear membrane . after lens removal, the first visible changes are    detected in nuclei of the mediodorsal iris cells and involve an increasein the number of primary nucleoli . later, the nuclei enlarge and becomespherical, and prominent nucleoli appear . these nucleoli can be        distinguished from the normal nucleoli by the presence of the granular  cortex surrounding the fibrous core .
