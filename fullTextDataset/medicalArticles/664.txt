the influence of methemoglobinemia on the lethality of some toxic       anions, 1. azide .                                                        the time course and extent of the methemoglobinemia induced by        intraperitoneal sodium nitrite and p-aminopropiophenone (papp) have beencharacterized in female mice . the peak methemoglobin formation (34 ) isachieved in about 40 minutes . comparable levels from papp (15 mg/kg)   are achieved more quickly (between 5 and 10 minutes) but decline more   rapidly to normal . both nitrite- and papp-induced methemoglobinemia    afford a significant degree of protection against poisoning by sodium   azide when administered in an appropriate time sequence . it was not    possible under the same circumstances to protect mice against death fromfluoride, cyanate, thiocyanate, selenate, or borate, although some      prolongation of survival time was seen after fluoride .
