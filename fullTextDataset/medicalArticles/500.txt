neurohypophysial principles in rats with familial hypothalamicdiabetes insipidus (brattleboro strain).antidiuretic and oxytocic assays wereperformed on tissues from 3 female rats withfamilial hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (di)and on 3 normal females.  oxytocicactivity was only slightly lower in the pituitariesfrom the di rats.  antidiuretic activityin the pituitaries from 2 di rats wasno more than that expected from theircontent of oxytocin.  thus, these pituitariesappeared to contain oxytocin but notarginine vasopressin.  the hypothalami fromthese 2 rats showed minimal antidiureticactivity, which might have been due tooxytocin or vasopressin.  the pituitaryfrom the third di rat contained more antidiureticactivity than could be due to oxytocin.
