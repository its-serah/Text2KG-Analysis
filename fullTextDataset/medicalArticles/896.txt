2379. in-vitro culture of pulmonary tumors in hamsters caused by adenovirus 12it is known that the adenoviruses 12 and18 provoke malignant tumors in thenew-born hamster.  the authors made a studyof the histogenesis of these tumors andexamined the specific changes brought aboutin the cells by the virus infectionmalignancy, presence of viral antigen, reactionsto superinfection.  when new-bornhamsters were inoculated in the chest withadenovirus 12, malignant tumorsdeveloped in one or two months, in 16 animalsout of 22.  these tumors presentedan epithelial aspect and were of bronchiolo-alveolarorigin.  they were transplant-able in vivo; if they were cultured in vitro,they consisted in the first few cultures ofmacrophages, fibroblasts and epithelium.in subsequent passages, there was aprogressive disappearance of the macrophagesand fibroblasts.
