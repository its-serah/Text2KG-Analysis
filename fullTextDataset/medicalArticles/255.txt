  Blood loss during surgery is usually attributable to the surgical traumainflicted and can be corrected by the standard hEmostatic techniques.Occasionally the amount of bleeding is out of proportion to the severity of the wound, either because of excessive arterial bleeding, or apersistent generalised bloody ooze that continues in spite of the usualhamostaticmeasures. Pathological bleeding may obscure the operativefield making surgery difficult and dangerous.It may cause largehamatomas, or it may be so severe and continous that adequate bloodreplacement becomes impossible and the patient’s life is endangered
