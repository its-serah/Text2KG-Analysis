787. further autoradiographic studies of the lens epithelium.normal and x-irradiated rat eyescell proliferation and migration inthe lens epithelium of normal and x-irradiatedrat eyes were studied by means ofautoradiography after labelling with tritiatedthymidine.  cells of the normal lensepithelium require 16 hr. to pass from thebeginning of the synthesizing periodto the completion of mitosis.  this interval ispartitioned as follows  s period,approximately 10 hr.; g2, slightly less than 5 hr;and mitosis, 72 min.  following division,labelled daughter cells migrate from thegerminative zone to the postequatorialrows, and by 2 weeks after tracer injectionmany radioactive nuclei are found in thelens bow.
