The relationship between egg, milk, and water and 
dental caries: A study carried out in Oregon is considered
to be a nonseleniferous area. It involved 2,069 children of
14 to 16 years of age in their three respective regions.
They found that reduced content of Selenium was present
in egg and milk in Klamath than Jackson and Josephine;
respective study regions. Moreover, the selenium content 
in the water of all these regions is very low in all three
areas. Most of the Selenium concentration is found in the
egg yolk [31]. 
5.Dental Caries in South India: Children from South India 
have a high prevalence of dental problems. Diet,
availability of sticky carbohydrate-rich food, presence of 
specific trace elements like Selenium, and relative
humidity in that area may all impact them [32].
