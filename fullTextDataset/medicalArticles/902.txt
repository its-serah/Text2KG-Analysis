Features of Fanconi anemia (FA) are well known, including bone marrow failure, congenital anomalies such as radial anomalies, renal and ear anomalies, tracheo-esophageal fistula, imperforate anus, and elevated risk for cancer. We sought to further characterize the endocrine phenotype in children and adults with FA. Clinically indicated endocrine evaluation data from 120 persons with FA, including 78 children (43 female) and 42 young adults (who had achieved adult height, 19 female), were entered in an institutional review board-approved database. Data were analyzed according to gender, birth weight, FA complementation group, and whether or not the patient had completed linear growth or had undergone hematopoietic cell transplant, using Wilcoxon Rank Sum or Chi-square, as appropriate.Â
