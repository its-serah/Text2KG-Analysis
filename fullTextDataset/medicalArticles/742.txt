  experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigens   were also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6     months of gestation . these components were named /carcinoembryonic/    antigens of the human digestive system ,on the basis of the present    findings and the recent work regarding control of the expression of     genetic potentialities in various genetic potentialities in various     types of cells, it was concluded that the carcinoembryonic antigens     represent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course ofdifferentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappear  in the corresponding malignant cells by a process of                    derepressive-dedifferentiation .
