1. Immune function: Selenium deficiency leads to loss of 
immunocompetence along with inefficiencies in cell-
mediated immunity and B-cell function [10]. This can 
increase the transcription of receptors for the growth-
regulating cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) on the surface of
activated lymphocytes and natural killer cells (NK cells),
allowing them to interact with IL-2 [11]. T-cell activity is 
activated and the immunological response is controlled by 
the enzyme selenocysteine synthetase 2 (SPS2) [12]. 
2.Viral infection: Beck and colleagues demonstrated that 
innocuous viruses may become virulent in a selenium-
deficient host, which is likely to facilitate the 
development of endemic human selenium-deficiency 
cardiomyopathy, known as Keshan Disease.
3.Reproduction: Selenium is necessary for testosterone 
synthesis or the production and normal development of
spermatozoa [13].
