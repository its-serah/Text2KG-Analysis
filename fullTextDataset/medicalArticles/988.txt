comparative studies of the glycogen content of heart, liver and brain   before and after iodine treatment and under conditions of asphyxia .      blood sugar level and glycogen concentration in the heart, brain and  liver of rabbits after treatment with inorganic iodine, depot insulin,  iodine and insulin combined, hostacortine and hostacortine and iodine   combined are being examined . a control group remains untreated . in a  second test series the glycogen determination under asphyxia (the       trachea is being pinched off for three minutes) is repeated .             contrary to the brain the glycogen content of the heart muscle is not dependent upon the blood sugar level . after iodine treatment a loweringof the blood sugar becomes noticeable, but also an increase in heart    glycogen .
