the effect of nortestosterone phenylpropionate on compensatoryhypertrophy of the remaining kidney after unilateral nephrectomy.forty-eight hr. after unilateral nephrectomy,both in non-castrated and in castratedmale mice the relative dry weight of theremaining kidney increased significantly.this compensatory hypertrophy was significantlystimulated as early as 96 hr. afteroperation by treatment with 19-nortestosteronephenylpropionate (= npp) at thetime of operation.  the percentual increaseof the kidney weight was approximatelythe same in non-castrated as in castratedmice.  the absolute initial values as wellas the resulting values 96 hr. after operationwere higher in non-castrated malemice than in castrated animals.
