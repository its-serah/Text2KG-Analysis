 xcretion patterns of urinary metabolites of estradiol-4-c14 in         postmenopausal women with benign and malignant disease of the breast .    a study of the excretion patterns of the urinary metabolites of       estradiol-4-c1j administered to a group of 43 postmenopausal women, 38  with advanced mammary carcinoma prior to endocrine therapy and 5 with   benign mammary dysplasia, is reported . a chromatographic method was    employed for the determination of estradiol, estrone, and estriol and   other estrogen metabolites . the urinary excretion pattern is defined by(a) the extent of excretion of isotope in each of 3 successive 24-hr.   collection periods, (b) the percentage of the urinary radiometabolites  enzymatically hydrolyzed, (c) the relative concentration of the several metabolites in the hydrolyzed fraction . wide subject-to-subject        variations were found .
