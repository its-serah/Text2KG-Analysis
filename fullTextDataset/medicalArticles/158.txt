a kinetic study of nickel(ii), complexes of sulfur-containing amino acid  the rate expression for the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta)    ligand exchange reaction with nickel(cysteine) is.. rate = k(complex) + kedta (complex)(edta) . this two-term rate expression is characteristic of square planar complexes and agrees with the square planar            configuration of ni(cysteine) reported on the basis of spectral studies the edta-independent term of the rate expression is an acid-catalyzed term and can be written k (h) (complex) . the value of kn is 2.5 x 10 m sec while the value of kedta is only on the order of 10 -10 m sec .
