the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney and thezona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex inthe sodium losing and the hypertensiveforms of virilizing adrenalhyperplasiapathological and biochemical observationsare presented in two cases of virilizing ad-renal hyperplasia: one of the sodium-losingtype and the other of the hypertensive type.examination of the kidneys revealed hyper-trophy of the juxtaglomerular cells in thecase exhibiting excessive sodium loss.  theadrenal cortex showed hypertrophy of thezona glomerulosa.  it is hypothesized thatthe chronic state of sodium loss causedchanges in the intravascular compartmentwhich led to compensatory activity of thejuxtaglomerular cells with resultant stimula-tion of the zona glomerulosa.
