266. immunology of the cancer cell: tumour-specific antigensafter a broad historical survey of immunologicalstudies of cancer, a review is givenof the evidence showing that antigens present innormal cells are missing from themalignant cells that arise from the same tissue.this evidence is considered in con-junction with the deletion hypothesis of carcinogenesis,and the author emphasizes,that in his view, the key event in carcinogenesisis enzymatic deletion.  antigenicgain and intensification in the course of spontaneous,chemical, and viral carcino-genesis is reviewed, together with experimentsdemonstrating the existence oftumour-specific antigens.
