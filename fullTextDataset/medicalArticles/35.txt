1463. investigations of lens protein and microelectrophoresis ofhydrosoluble protein in senile cataractthe investigations on lens protein andon agar-microelectrophoresis of hydro-soluble protein in normal lenses and in those affected with senile cataract re-vealed the following facts  (1) in opaquelenses, a diminution of the total proteinand the soluble protein takes place, aswell as an increase in the amount of in-soluble protein.  the decrease in thequantity of soluble protein is higher than theincrease of insoluble protein which doesnot only point to a transformation of thesoluble protein into the insoluble variety,but also to the disappearance of a proteinfraction from the lens.
