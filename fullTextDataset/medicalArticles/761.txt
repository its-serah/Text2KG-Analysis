hypophysectomy, replacement therapy, and the tolerance of theeuryhaline killifish, fundulus heteroclitus, to hypotonic mediahypophysectomized fundulus heteroclitus, as previously reported, survive only afew days after transfer from salt to fresh water.  survival time is the samewhen fish are tested 2 weeks or 2 months after hypophysectomy.  gradualdilution of the external medium produces failure at an average salinity of0.26% (0.67-0.02%).  this salinity is comparable to that causing failure afterabrupt transfer.  although failure is associated with hypochloremia, dailyinjections of a balanced salt solution or 0.6% nacl shorten survival.daily injections of teleostean neurohypophysial peptides, arginine vasotocin(2.25 and 0.0225 pressor mu per gram) and isotocin (1.32 and 0.026 oxytocic muper gram) do not prolong survival.  an extract of caudal neurosecretory tissue(urophysis) from male tilapia mossambica had no beneficial action at doses of50 ug per gram every other day.
