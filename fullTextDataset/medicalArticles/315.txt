rate of change of carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood, jugular     venous blood and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid on carbon dioxide        administration .                                                          1. the rate of change of p in arterial blood and cisternal c.s.f., wasmeasured following 5 percent co administration in eight anaesthetized   patients undergoing routine air encephalography . ventilation was       maintained constant throughout the procedure by a respirator . in three of the experiments the rate of change of p in the jugular venous blood  was also measured .                                                       2. the rise in p varied between 25.7 and 14.8 mm hg . the final       samples of blood and c.s.f. were taken 20-25 min after the start of co  administration in five experiments . at this time the mean rise in p was65.9 (maximum range 68.1-61.6 percent) of the rise in p .
