The beta-glucuronidase in homogenates of 12-day chick embryo livers catalyzed the release of glucuronic acid from 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide and from the nonreducing terminals of the hexasaccharides of chondroitin-6-SO4 and chondroitin-4-SO4 at rates of 143, 114, and 108 nmol of glucuronic acid/h/mg of protein, respectively, when assayed at pH 3.5 in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer. During a 60-fold purification of the enzyme, the ratios of the activities on these substrates did not change. When 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide was used as substrate the enzyme was active at pH values from 3.0 to 5.5, with maximal activity between pH values 4.0 and 4.5. Concentrations of NaCl from 0.15 to 0.3 M inhibited the activity at low pH values but activated the enzyme between pH 4.0 and 5.5. The enzyme was active on the chondroitin-6-SO4 hexasaccharide from pH 3.0 to 5.5, with a broad optimum between 3.0 and 4.5.Â
