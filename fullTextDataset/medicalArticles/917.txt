The reader is referred to reference 2 formore detailed description of these methods. Sectionswere examined in a Siemens Elmiskop IIb andphotographed on Gevaert Scientia 19 D 50 plates,with development in D 19. Initial magnifications ofmicrographs range from 1400 to 29,000. Satisfactorypreparations from one animal at each interval wereexamined electron microscopically with the exceptionof the 30 day period in which case lesions from 3animals were observed.Â
