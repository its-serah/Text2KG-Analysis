The protein toxin present in Bordetella pertussisvaccine blocks the inhibition of adenylate cyclase byprostaglandins and adenosine which may be secondaryto ADP-ribosylation of an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The stimulatory effects of alcatecholamine agonists on 32P uptake into phosphatidicacid and phosphatidylinositol in isolated rat adipocyteswere virtually abolished by pertussis toxin treatment.In contrast, the stimulatory effects of insulin wereincreased in adipocytes after pertussis toxin treatment.Pertussis toxin treatment did not alter insulin stimulation of glucose oxidation and actually increased glucose conversion to lipid. Basal lipolysis was elevatedin adipocytes by pertussis toxin treatment but not basalcyclic AMP. However, the increases in cyclic AMP andlipolysis due to low concentrations of catecholaminesand forskolin were markedly potentiated by pertussistoxin treatment. The inhibitory effects of adenosine oncyclic AMP stimulation due to catecholamines wereabolished by pertussis toxin.Â
