isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from adults with respiratoryinfections.isolation of mycoplasma organisms from the sputumwas attempted in 254 patients with various syndromeof respiratory disease.  isolates were obtained in 56% ofthe 197 patients with pneumonia, 50% of patients withchronic bronchial diseases who were not treated withtetracycline, and 33% of persons with acute upper respiratoryinfection.  these differences are not statisticallysignificant and indicate a nonpathogenic role for m.pharyngis and m. salivarium which were the strains mostfrequently isolated.  the highest frequency of isolationwas from males 15 to 30 yr. of age.  isolation of m.pneumoniae requires one to 2 weeks:therefore, it is notuseful for rapid diagnosis.  also, it underestimates theprevalence of infection, especially if patients have receivedtetracycline.  of the serologic tests, complement-fixation(cf) was the most specific.
