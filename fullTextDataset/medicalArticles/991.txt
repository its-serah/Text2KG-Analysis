1139. optimal coronary flow in the bypassed normothermic and hypothermic hearta series of experiments were conducted in dogsin which bypass flow, temperature,and direct coronary perfusion pressure were varied.coronary flow, coronary ven-ous saturation, myocardial oxygen consumption (mvo2),and coronary vascular re-sistance were assayed.  coronary flow as a percentageof total bypass flow did notvary appreciably at varying levels of bypass flow.induction of hypothermia, whentotal bypass flow is constant, results in decreasingcoronary flow.  induction of hy-pothermia when maintaining a constant bypass pressureresults in an increasingcoronary flow with temperatures down to 22 c.further cooling causes a reductionin flow.
