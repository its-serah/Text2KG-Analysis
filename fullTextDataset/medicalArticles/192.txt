oophorectomy and cortisone treatment as a method of eliminating         oestrogen production in patients with breast cancer .                     the urinary excretion of oestrone, oestradiol-17b, oestriol, and 17-  hydroxycorticosteroids has been estimated in 55 premenopausal and 91    postmenopausal women with breast cancer at various stages of the diseasebefore therapy . the depletion of oestrogen excretion caused by         oophorectomy combined with cortisone treatment was studied in the       patients with metastasising breast tumours (32 premenopausal and 56     postmenopausal subjects) .                                                patients with disseminating breast cancer excreted significantly      larger quantities of oestriol than healthy women of the same age,       whether pre- or postmenopausal . the excretion of oestrone and          oestradiol-17b was similar in cancer patients and healthy women of      corresponding age .                                                       oophorectomy reduced the oestrogen excretion not only in premenopausalsubjects but also in quite a number of postmenopausal patients,         particularly in those who were still excreting significant amounts of   oestrogens . this decrease in the oestrogen output was transient and wasfollowed by a compensatory increase, possibly of adrenal origin .
