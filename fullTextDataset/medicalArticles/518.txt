the morphologic demonstration of an alveolar lining layer and its       relationship to pulmonary surfactant .                                    the presence of an alveolar lining layer was histologically           demonstrated in animal lungs by ultraviolet microscopy . this layer     appeared as a thin fluorescent line at the air-tissue interface .         the fluorescent lining layer could be abolished from lung sections by extraction with chloroform..methanol and was diminished by digestion    with cl.welchii a-toxin lecithinase, suggesting that the structure was alecithin-containing lipid . an alveolar lining structure was also       identified by the use of phosphatide and polysaccharide stains,         suggesting that the lipid was a phosphatide, but that a                 mucopolysaccharide component might also be present .                      bilateral cervical vagotomy resulted in diminution or loss of the     fluorescent alveolar lines and abnormal surface tension properties of   lung extracts .
