concurrence of hyperplasia andneoplasia of the parathyroid glandsthe concurrence of parathyroid hyperplasiaand neoplasia in a group of six patients is re-ported.  two patients had long-standing renaldisease with azotemia and hyperphosphatemia.in both hypercalcemia developed while theywere under observation and they were found tohave parathyroid adenomas as well as hyper-plasia of the other glands.  a third patientfollowed an apparently similar course.  one pa-tient with primary hyperparathyroidism due to alarge mediastinal adenoma displayed hyper-plasia of other glands in association with moder-ate renal insufficiency.  two patients with pri-mary generalized parathyroid hyperplasia werefound to have superimposed neoplastic lesions:multiple adenomatous nodules in one, adenocar-cinoma in the other.
