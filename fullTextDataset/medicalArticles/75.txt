4. the protamine titration test provides a crude but simple and       satisfactory means of monitoring free-heparin levels .                    5. complete neutralization of heparin is an important factor in       minimizing postoperative blood losses .                                   6. protamine is a less efficient neutralizing agent than polybrene at the same dosage level . it may be most effective in divided dosage .      7. /rebound/ was detected in 5 of 45 cases studied, although in only  one instance was it of a degree likely to be significant .                8. significant prolongation of the clotting-time resulting from excessneutralizing agent, was not evident in this study .
