A new myelin sheath is being formed around one of the previously demyclinatcdaxons. The lettered arrows point to portions of the sheath which appear enlarged inFig. 2. Other axons arc not yet invested with myelin and, therefore, remain clusteredtogether but for a few invading glial processes (gp). Glial expansions arc identified bythe contained fibrils (f). Lying adjacent to one of the glial processes is a thin denselayer, marked by an arrow, found characteristically near collagen. Collagen (c) ispresent at this site; it is also vlsiblc at the upper left where its typical handing may beseen. Note that the collagen appears markedly different from glial fibrils. There issome extracellular space (Â¢s). Posterior columns, 24 d.p.o. X 19,500.
