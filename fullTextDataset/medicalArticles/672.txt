the relationship between vitamin d and parathyroidhormonemarit von stedingkthe effect of parathyroidectomy and parathy-roid hormone administration upon the concentra-tions of plasma calcium and phosphate have beenmeasured in vitamin d-deficient rats and the re-sults compared to those observed in d-fed ani-mals.  also, the influence of dietary calcium andphosphate content upon these responses has beeninvestigated.  parathyroidectomy in the d-fed ani-mal results in a rapid fall in plasma calcium and abiphasic plasma phosphate response with an initialfall followed by a striking rise.  in contrast,parathyroidectomy in the d-deficient rat is fol-lowed by no significant change in plasma calciumand an immediate rise in plasma phosphate thatcan be prevented by the administration of para-thyroid hormone.
