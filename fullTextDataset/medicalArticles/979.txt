7839.cortical ph and the blood-brain barriera method was described for measuringthe ph, dc and ac potentials concurrentlyon the cerebral cortex of the adult cat,under conditions of controlled ventilation.kittens and rabbits were also studied.the cortical ph response to i.v. nahco3was acidic and was accompanied by adc negativity, while the blood became alkaline.such an acidic response was present inthe rabbit and kitten.  it was not presentin a number of other tissues in the cat,including the dura.  the cortical acidicresponse was not affected, qualitatively,by i.v. acetazolamide, prolonged hypoxiaor 10% (v/v) co2.
