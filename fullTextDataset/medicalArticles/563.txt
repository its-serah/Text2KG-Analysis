1560. the ultrastructure of the lungs of lambs.  the relation of osmiophilicinclusions and alveolar lining layer to fetal maturation and experimentallyproduced respiratory distressthe lungs in 69 fetal and newborn lambswere studied.  osmiophilic inclusion bodiesfirst appeared at about 121 days gestationand their total number increased withmaturation.  normal surface activity oflung extracts was detectable a few daysfollowing the appearance of inclusionbodies.  the excretory nature of the type iialveolar epithelial cell, the phospholipidnature of the inclusion body content, thedecrease in the number of inclusionbodies and their loss of density associatedwith respiratory distress and with theloss of normal surface activity of lung ex-tracts provide strong evidence thatinclusion bodies are the source of pulmonarysurfactant.
