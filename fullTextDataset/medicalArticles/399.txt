Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive bacterium, a promising microorganism due to its strong extracellular protein secretion ability, non-toxic, and relatively mature industrial fermentation technology. However, cell autolysis during fermentation restricts the industrial application of B. subtilis. With the fast advancement of molecular biology and genetic engineering technology, various advanced procedures and gene editing tools have been used to successfully construct autolysis-resistant B. subtilis chassis cells to manufacture various biological products. This paper first analyses the causes of autolysis in B. subtilis from a mechanistic perspective and outlines various strategies to address autolysis in B. subtilis. Finally, potential strategies for solving the autolysis problem of B. subtilis are foreseen.
