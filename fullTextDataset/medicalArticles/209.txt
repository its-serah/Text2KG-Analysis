 intellectual capacity could not be cor-related with the basic etiology of thehydrocephalus, but did correlate in-versely with duration of increased in-tracranial pressure.the many etiologies of hydrocephalusrequire large numbers of patients in eachgroup for thorough evaluation.  factorsfavoring such studies should be carried out inmedical centers where appropriate disciplinescan study in depth.  prevention should be theultimate goal.in the operative group, only 1 patientcompensated his hydrocephalic process andno single patient demonstrated "arrest" of orrecovery from the basic hydrocephalus-pro-ducing process in spite of numerous attemptsto demonstrate this.  this might imply anecessity for life-long shunting of cerebro-spinal fluid in these cases.
