the meaning of ph at low temperatures during extra-corporeal circulation  a review of the temperature gradients occurring during profound       hypothermia is made in regard to acid base changes in general, and to phreadings in particular . it is concluded that terms such as 'body',     'mean', 'average' and 'core' temperature should be discarded and that   when a temperature is quoted it should be referred to the site at which it was measured .                                                         the main circumstances in which blood ph is measured at a temperature different from that at which the blood is equilibrated with respiratory gases are reviewed by describing the changes which occur during         tonometry experiments . in this way fundamental changes can be          understood before considering the more complicated sequences of events  taking place in the living body .
