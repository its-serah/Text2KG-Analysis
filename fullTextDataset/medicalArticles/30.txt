on the mechanism of genetic recombination in transforming bacillus      subtilis .                                                                the molecular fate of transforming dna in competent bacillus subtilis has been studied . the physical differentiation of transforming dna and the genetic material of recipient bacteria was effected by employing theisotopes n and p . competent bacteria labeled with n and p were allowed to incorporate n p-labeled transforming dna intracellularly . dna was   isolated from these recipient cells and centrifuged in cesium chloride .analysis of drop fractions collected at equilibrium showed the presence of radioactivity in a region of density corresponding to recipient dna .material contribution from donor dna to the resident dna did not occur  when genetically inert bacillus cereus dna was substituted for          homologous dna .
