maternal separation in the rhesus monkey .                                the present study involved separation of eight monkey mother-infant   pairs for a period of two weeks and measurement of the behavior of the  infants before, during and after reunion with their mothers, and of the mothers before and after reunion . all infants showed emotional         disturbance in response to separation and drastic decreases in play and other complex social behaviors while separated .                          it is clear that infant-mother separation produces emotional          disturbance in both human and macaque infants and that the patterns of  responses following separation are similar in both species . the resultsobtained in studies of monkey infant-mother separation indicate that    sheer physical separation is the crucial aspect of maternal separation  for monkeys .
