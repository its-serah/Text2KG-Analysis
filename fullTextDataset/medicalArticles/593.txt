1577. mode of action of selenium in relation to biological activity oftocopherolsdietary selenium at levels below 1 ppm has a partially beneficial effectupon nutritional muscular dystrophy but is ineffective or detrimentalat higher levels.  the role of selenium in improving the effectiveness ofvitamin e is due at least in part to the fact that dietary selenium increasesthe retention of the a-tocopherols, especially d-a-tocopherol.  this has beenshown by chemical determination of plasma tocopherols and also by tracing theactivities of tritiated tocopherols and selenium75 in serum and in variousfractions of serum proteins in chicks receiving these nutrients alone and incombination.  se75 and h3-a-tocopherol activities followed each other veryclosely in the serum proteins.
