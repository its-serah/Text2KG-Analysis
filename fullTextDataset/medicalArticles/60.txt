influence of parathyroid activity on ionexchange in various tissues1. balance data from three patients with hypoparathyroidism, who weregiven parathyroid extract, are presented.  the metabolic response wascomplex.  the data demonstrate losses of phosphate, magnesium, sodiumand potassium which were not accounted for by destruction of either boneor non-osseous tissues.  preferential depletion of these minerals from bone,or loss from non-osseous tissues, must be presumed.2. the exchange of ca45, mg28, and p32 in a spectrum of rat tissues hasbeen studied in sham operated, parathyroidectomized, and parathyroidextract treated rats.  the effects of parathyroidectomy on the developmentof magnesium deficiency were determined.
