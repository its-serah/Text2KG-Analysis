Haemophilia is a rarely seen, X-linked recessive coagulation disorder in which deficiencies of certain clotting factors are the cause of haemorrhage with minor trauma or surgery. The three types of haemophilia are haemophilia A, B and C. The most common form, haemophilia A, occurs in 1 in 5000 male births. The deficient factor (f) is fVIII. Haemophilia B affects only 1 in 50â€‰000, where there is fIX deficiency. Although bleeding can occur at almost any age, it usually comes to clinical attention by the age of one year with unexpected bruising over the extremities or haemarthrosis as the most common clinical manifestations.
