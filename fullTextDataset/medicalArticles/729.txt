3805. cisternal fluid oxygen tension in manmeasurement of cerebral oxygen tensionin man has been hampered by technical dif-ficulties.  the authors present a methodin which a beckman microelectrode wasintroduced into the cisterna magna andoxygen tension measured, the hypothesisbeing that measurement of oxygen tensionin a fluid which equilibrates with theaverage cerebral oxygen tension shouldgive reliable measure of cerebral oxygentension.  in their subjects, inhalation ofpure oxygen produced an increase in theoxygen tension in the cisternal fluid aswell as in the arterial blood without anyalteration of the oxygen tension in thebulb of the internal jugular vein, whereasinhalation of 95% oxygen and 5% carbondioxide increased the oxygen tension in thecisternal fluid as well as in the arterialand venous blood.
