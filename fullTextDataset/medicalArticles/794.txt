GLUCOSE correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery.
CORRELATION correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery.
DELIVERY from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level.
FETAL FFA LEVELS significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels.
