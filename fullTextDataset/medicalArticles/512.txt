studies on loiasis in monkeys.iv.--experimental hybridization of the human andsimian strains of loain the cameroons rain-forest there exist two strains of loa, each apparentlyevolving in its own host-vector complex (duke and wijers, 1958).  the naturalsimian parasite which is found most abundantly in the drill (mandrillusleucophaeus), is characterized by the large somatic size of the adult wormsand microfilariae and by its nocturnal microfilariae periodicity.  it istransmitted among the monkey population by the crepuscular canopy-dwellingchrysops langi and c. centurionis.  the natural human parasite has diurnallyperiodic microfilariae and is transmitted by the day-biting anthropophilicc. silacea and c. dimidiata (bombe form).  it can also be transmittedexperimentally to the drill, in which host the parasites are of small somaticsize and maintain their diurnal periodicity.
