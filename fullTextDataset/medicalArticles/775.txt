some intraspecies differences in antigens onthe surface of certain living human cellssurface antigens of several types of living cells of humanorigin were partially characterized with hyperimmune antisera prepared inthe rabbit against living hela cells and living, uncultured, full-term, humanamnion cells.  hemagglutination, mixed-agglutination, and direct andindirect immunofluorescence (fab) techniques were employed.  withthese techniques and fractional absorption procedures, common and specificcell antigens were detected on the surface of several human living cells:uncultured and primary amnion, two established human cell lines (rp am 1and u amnion) of presumed normal origin and two (hela and hep-2) ofpresumed malignant origin, and human erythrocytes.  none of the antigenswere found on nctc 2555 mouse cells.  the human cells possessed species-related antigens demonstrable by hemagglutination.
