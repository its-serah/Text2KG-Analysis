The effect of supplementing layer diets with different selenium (Se) sources on egg Se concentration, egg physical parameters and hens performance was studied. 72 hens of ISA Brown genotype were randomly divided into four groups (18 hens per group). The group I was control-without Se addition, the next three groups were fed with 0.3 mg/kg" of Se added from Na2Se03-group II, Sel-Plex (AlItech, Inc)-group III, ChlorelIa-group IV. There was found significantly highest Se concentration (P < 0.05) both in egg yolk and in egg white in group III and IV. Significantly higher Se concentration was even in group II compare to control group. In groups with Se addition were found insignificantly higher egg production and egg weight compare to control group, which correspond to decreased egg shell thickness and egg shell strength in these groups. Egg white weight was significantly higher in group III compare to control group.Â
