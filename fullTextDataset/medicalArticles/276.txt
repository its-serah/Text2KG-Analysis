Hemophilia is an inherited X-linked bleeding condition with predominant joint involvement due to intra-articular bleeding, hemosiderin deposition and the synovial hypertrophy that is responsible for cartilage destruction, joint deformity and malalignment, pain and functional restriction. Management of chronic arthropathy includes conservative and surgical approaches. Conservative therapies consist of pain modulation, oral drugs, physiotherapy and intra-articular agents. For the present review, the literature was searched for intra-articular agents and 20 papers on the use of corticosteroids (CS), hyaluronic acid (HA) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), with different regimes of administration, were included. CS had a longer record of injection, with statistically significant pain reduction and functional improvement in the short-term and moderate persistence in the long-term.Â
