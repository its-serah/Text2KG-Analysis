cardiac malformations associated with ventricular septal defect .         in this study, 46 necropsy-proved cases of ventricular septal defect  associated with another anomaly but not part of a recognized complex    were selected .                                                           the associated anomalies were classified as (1) obstructive or        positional anomalies of the great vessels, (2) anomalies responsible foradditional shunts, (3) anomalies causing intraventricular obstruction   and (4) aortic valvular insufficiency .                                   clinical findings were often those of the ventricular septal defect,  and the findings related to the associated lesion were frequently       obscure . even with special studies, including cardiac catheterization  and angiocardiography, there was often failure to arrive at a complete  diagnosis . the findings which led to an erroneous or incomplete        diagnosis have been presented . when a complete diagnosis was made      preoperatively, the procedures leading to it have been outlined .
