isozymes of lactic dehydrogenase.. sequential alterations during        development .                                                             applications of isozymes in various biological contexts have been     reviewed . diagnosis of several disease states has been facilitated by  examination of the serum isozyme pattern which has been shown to        correlate in some conditions with the isozyme pattern of pathologically involved tissues . physico-chemical studies of human ldh isozymes have  revealed differences among isozymes in affinity for a given substrate . comparative studies of ldh isozymes within the erythrocyte from various vertebrate species demonstrated a marked species variation in the numberof ldh isozymes, in the distribution of total ldh activity among them,  and in their electrophoretic mobilities .
