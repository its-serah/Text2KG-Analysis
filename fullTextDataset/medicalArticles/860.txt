treatment of short stature in children and adolescentswith human pituitary growth hormone (raben).  experiencewith thirty-five cases.human pituitary growth hormone (raben) wasevaluated by longitudinal study ofgrowth as a therapeutic agent in the treatmentof short stature.  clinically significantincreases in growth rate were achieved in 11of 13 hypopituitary patients.  no significantimprovement in linear growth rate wasnoted with a dose of 2 mg 3 timesweekly in children whose short stature was dueto other conditions.  no adverse reactionswere noted; thyroidal, adrenal or gonadalactivation was not observed.  growthwas stimulated, probably without an undue increasein bone age, though this pointdemands continued scrutiny.
