the pathogenesis of viral influenzal pneumonia in mice .                  the pathogenesis of influenzal pneumonia in mice was studied by       electron microscopy . mice were inoculated with 1.5 ld of pr8 influenza virus and killed at varying intervals after inoculation . observations  by light microscopy were correlated with those by electron microscopy inorder to evaluate the lesions produced .                                  at the periphery, the earliest lesions were focal areas of edema of   alveolar lining cells, the capillary endothelium and the interposed     basement membrane . this caused an appreciable thickening of the        blood-air pathway .
