urinary excretion of neutral 17-ketosteroids and pregnanediol by        patients with prostatic cancer and benign prostatic hypertrophy .         urinary neutral 17-ketosteroid fractions and pregnanediol excreted by 21 patients with prostatic cancer, 17 patients with benign hypertrophy, and 59 clinically well subjects were assayed to determine whether       differences exist .                                                       patients with prostatic cancer and those with benign hypertrophy      excreted significantly less androsterone than the clinically well       subjects . a disproportionately lower level of androsterone than        etiocholanolone resulted in a significantly lower                       androsterone/etiocholanolone ratio in both groups .                       the specificity of the findings is discussed . the lower levels of    androsterone excreted by patients with benign hypertrophy were          associated with an extended period of hospitalization . patients        hospitalized less than 5 days excreted androsterone at levels not       significantly different from the clinically well subjects .
