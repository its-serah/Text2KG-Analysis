Thiazolidin-4-one scaffold has great potential for medicinal chemistry and is of interest to scientists in view of wide spectrum of biological activity. This scaffold is often used for designing of small molecules with various biological activity including antituberculosis activity. The presented review is an attempt to gather, analyze and systemize data about antitubercular properties of thiazolidine-4-ones from two last decades. Some of them have promising antitubercular activity which is significantly higher than that of the reference drugs. Among them compounds 82c, 82d and 84 that were active against M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain with MICs in the range of 0.05-0.2 μg/mL and compound 108 exhibited activity with MIC = 0.36 μM. Compounds 115a-115c and 116a-116c were very effective against M.
