distribution of transfused tritiated cytidine-labeled leukocytes and redcells in the bone marrow of normal and irradiated rat .                   in normal rats and after total body irradiation with 550 r of x-rays, the fate in the bone marrow of labeled nucleated and red cells of       transfused peripheral blood was observed autoradiographically .           labeled nucleated cells, most of which were lymphocyte-like cells,    readily migrated into the marrow parenchyma in normal animals (2 cells/ 1,000 parenchymal cells/hr.) . following irradiation to at least 27-51  hr., this migration appeared to be relatively increased . beyond this   time, parenchymal areas were more difficult to be defined as such .       labeled red cells were rarely observed to enter parenchyma despite thepresence of nonlabeled erythrocytes within the parenchymal structure    after irradiation .
