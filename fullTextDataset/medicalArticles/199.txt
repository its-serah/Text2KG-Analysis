establishment of a cell line in vitro from a case of human lung cancer .  1) one cell line has been established from the pneumonectomized       specimen of a case with lung cancer, which was diagnosed as             undifferentiated cell carcinoma and partially adenocarcinoma by its     histological findings and was characterized with intracytoplasmic fat   droplets in them .                                                        2) the morphological changes of the cells were repeated but they have been stabilized to their epithelial shapes after the 35th transfer . thecell atypy of the culture was remarkable . phagocytosis of the cell linehas not been observed . it was characterized that the intracytoplasmic  droplets found in the original cancer cells have been maintained in the cultured cells, even in their mitotic stage, throughout the cultural    course .
