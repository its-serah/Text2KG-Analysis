3831. relative ability of parentalmarrow to repopulate lethal-ly irradiated f1 hybridslethally irradiate (c57bl x 101)f1 miceinjected with a mixture of 10 millionc57bl and 10 million 101 bone-marrowcells were repopulated only by the 101bone-marrow cells.  experiments with othercell mixtures indicated that the 101marrow was relatively nine times as efficientas c57bl marrow in repopulatinglethally irradiated (c57bl x 101)f1 mice.results from additional strain combina-tions suggested that the behavior of thedonor marrows was not determined solelyby h-2 factors.  c57bl marrow, whichfrequently regresses in irradiated f1 mice,has shown to be relatively less capableof repopulating the recipient than regularlyretained parental marrow.
