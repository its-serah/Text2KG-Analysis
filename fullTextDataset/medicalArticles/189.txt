recovery of mycoplasmas in the study ofhuman leukaemia and other malignanciesnumerous reports have been published concerning thenecessity of testing for the presence of mycoplasmas beforethe interpretation of experiments performed in cellcultures.  such tests are especially important whenthe presence of viruses is suspected, since recent evidenceindicates that some mycoplasmas are capable of elicitinga transmissible cytopathic effect.in addition, some mycoplasmas and viruses shareproperties, such as size, filterability, morphology inelectron microscopy, sensitivity to ether, ability tohaemagglutinate and cause haemadsorption, interferencewith virus replication in vitro, lack of inhibition by certaincommonly used antibiotics and inhibition of growth byhomologous antiserum.
