changes in sphingosine and fatty acid components of the gangliosides in developing rat and human brain .                                          rat brain increases in weight after birth in three stages.. (i)       rapidly for the first 2 weeks, (ii) at a lower rate from 2 to 5 weeks,  and (iii) at a still lower rate from 5 weeks to 5 months . during the   succeeding period, designated iv, it maintains constant weight up to 1  year of age . brain ganglioside content increased linearly during i and ii, more slowly during iii, and diminished during iv . the appearance ofmeasurable amounts of brain sphingomyelin and cerebroside succeeded thatof ganglioside .
