experimental onchocercal ocular lesions in the chimpanzeethis is the first attempt to produceonchocercal eye lesions with microfilariae ofo. volvulus in the chimpanzee.live microfilariae, once in the anteriorchamber of the eye, could penetrate the an-gle of the anterior chamber, the iris, theciliary body, the choroid and the vitreous.most of the microfilariae injected aliveinto the anterior chamber of the eyes of thechimpanzee died within a short time. Â com-parison, therefore, could not be made be-tween the effects of live and dead micro-filariae.
