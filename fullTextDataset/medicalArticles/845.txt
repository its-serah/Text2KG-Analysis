Taylor-Robinson, David (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.), Norman L. Somerson, Horace C. Turner, and Robert M. Chanock. Serological relationships among human mycoplasmas as shown by complement-fixation and gel diffusion. J. Bacteriol. 85 1261–1273. 1963.—Antigenic relationships among human mycoplasmas were studied by complement-fixation and agar gel diffusion techniques. Four recognized human species Mycoplasma hominis type 1, M. hominis type 2, M. salivarium, and M. fermentans were antigenically distinct in these tests. In addition, M. pneumoniae (Eaton agent, the etiological agent of cold agglutinin-positive atypical pneumonia) was different from these four species.
