FREE FATTY ACID the hypothesis is presented that the maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat accumulation.
MOTHERS the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers.
PLASMA FREE FATTY units of heparin into female sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose.
FETUSES the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers.
