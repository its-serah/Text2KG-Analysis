Liver functional failure is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Systemic chemotherapy usually offers a modest benefit in terms of disease control rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival at the cost of a significant percentage of adverse events. Liver malignancies are mostly perfused by the hepatic artery while the normal liver parenchyma by the portal vein network. On these bases, the therapeutic strategy consisting of hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy takes place. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on this approach from different points of view, such as techniques, drugs pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, and clinical outcomes for advanced hepatobiliary cancers. Most of the collected studies have several limitations: non-randomized retrospective design, a relatively small number of patients, the hepatic arterial administration of different chemotherapeutic agents, as well as its combination with a great heterogeneity of systemic agents. However, despite these limitations, the presented data show favorable results in terms of safety and efficacy for hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy, with respect or in alternative to the gold standard treatment, even when they are combined with systemic treatments. Therefore, this therapeutic strategy may be an alternative or an integrative treatment option for advanced hepatobiliary cancers. Further and larger prospective, randomized, multi-center studies, with well-defined inclusion criteria and treatment strategies, are required to confirm the presented data.
