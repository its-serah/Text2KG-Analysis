What does the sense of hearing contribute to humandevelopment? To answer the question, we must askwhat the sense of hearing gives the child. Hearinggives the child the acoustic correlates of the physicalworld: approaching footsteps, dog barks, car horns,and the pitter-patter of rain. Hearing also allowsthe child to revel in the patterned complexity of aBeethoven symphony or a mother’s lullaby. Childrenwho are born deaf clearly miss a great deal. However, hearing conveys much more to the growingchild than the acoustics of the physical world. Hearing is the sensory modality through which childrenperceive speech — the universe of talk that ties individuals, families and societies together. Childrenborn with bilateral hearing losses that are severe(70–89 dB loss) or profound (>90 dB loss) are referred to as deaf.
