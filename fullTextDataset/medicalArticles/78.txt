Rhinoplasty (RIE-no-plas-tee) is surgery that changes the shape of the nose. The reason for rhinoplasty may be to change the appearance of the nose, improve breathing or both.
The upper part of the structure of the nose is bone. The lower part is cartilage. Rhinoplasty can change bone, cartilage, skin or all three. Talk with your surgeon about whether rhinoplasty is appropriate for you and what it can achieve.
Â 
Your other facial features, the skin on your nose and what you would like to change are considered when planning the procedure. If you're a candidate for rhinoplasty, the surgeon will develop a personal plan for you.
Sometimes part or all of a rhinoplasty is covered by insurance.
