        the renal disease  was indistinguishable from that seen in other forms of the nephrotic    syndrome, with the possible exceptions of (a) a high incidence of       purpuric skin lesions, (b) a low or negligible incidence of hypertension(at times actual hypotension was prominent), and (c) a rapid and        inexorable progression of azotemia despite persistence of the clinical  and biochemical characteristics of the nephrotic syndrome . amyloidosis was found by percutaneous renal biopsy in 12 per cent of 83 adults with the nephotic syndrome .corticosteroids did not appear to affect the progress of the disease  and were neither beneficial nor detrimental .
