Current measures for the prevention of dirofilariasis, caused by the dog heartworm, Dirofilaria immitis, rely on macrocyclic lactones, but evidence of drug-resistant isolates has called for alternative approaches to disease intervention. As microfilariae are known to be in a state of developmental arrest in their mammalian host and then undergo two molts once inside the arthropod, the aim of this study was to look at the developmental regulation of D. immitis microfilariae that occurs in their arthropod host using in vitro approaches and to investigate the role of the ecdysone signaling system in this development regulation.
