immunological studies on filariasis.  iii.  fractionation andpurification of antigen for intradermal skin reaction in filariasis.it had been reported that the antigen tcaobtained from adult worms of dirofilariaimmitis produced noticeable reactions infilariasis patients in whose blood microfilariaecould be demonstrated.  further fractionationand purification of this antigenwas attempted in order to study thesubstance responsible for the skinreaction and to obtain a more reliableantigen with high sensitivity and specificity.the fraction fs obtained by treatmentsimilar to that described inthe previous report was used as parent material.by gel-filtration and sephadexg-100 column chromatography of antigen fs,antigen fsi, which produced noticeablereactions in the filariasis patients,was obtained.  this highly reactive antigenfsi was separated into 6 fractions, viz.fsc-1,fsc-2, fsc-3, fsc-4, fsc-5 andfsc-6, by cm cellulose chromatography.
