Cats of either sex, weighing 2.2 to 3.6 kg. and therefore considered mature, were used for this study.They were subjected to repeated withdrawal andreinjection of eerebrospinal fluid (e.s.f.) (2), and themost severely afflicted animals of those so treatedwere sacrificed 19, 24, 30, 45, 64, 100, 220, 369, or460 days later. (Radioactive tracers had been injected into the intrathecal space of the 24, 30 (oneof three cats), 64, and 369 day animals a few hoursprior to sacrifice to permit autoradiographic study(16).) Peripheral cord was fixed in situ in the anesthetized animal by replacing all c.s.f, available atcisternal puncture with 3 per cent osmium tetroxidein veronal acetate buffer (pH 7.5).Â
