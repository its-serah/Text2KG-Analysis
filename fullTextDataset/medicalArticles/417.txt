implications of gerstmann's syndrome .                                    of 465 consecutive patients subjected to a standardized battery of    neuropsychological tests, 111 had one or more components of gerstmann's syndrome . each of these 111 patients had some evidence of organic braindysfunction in addition to gerstmann components . as the number of      gerstmann components increased, the responsible brain lesions tended to be larger, more highly destructive of tissue, and to cause greater      neurological impairment . every patient with four gerstmann components  had associated evidence of severe impairment of brain functions and the lesion or underlying disease was likely to compromise survival of the   patient . the syndrome is not to be regarded as an autonomous entity,   but merges with numerous other neurological deficits, notably dysphasia in agreement with benton, we find no justification for singling out   the four gerstmann components as a separate syndrome, unless one is alsoprepared to recognize that any other arbitrary groups of concurrent     deficits are also separate syndromes .
