3927. studies on growth and cytomorphosisin the thymo-lympha-tic systems - with specialreference to the influence ofthe thymus and the thyroidin guinea-pigsmigratory streams of lymphocytes betweendifferent parts of the thymo-lymphaticsystem were evaluated by comparisons betweenlymphocyte populations in thoracic-duct lymph and arterial and venous blood,especially thymic venous blood.  by re-cording organ weights in sham-operated andthymectomized guinea-pigs, treatedwith thyroxin or untreated, the importanceof the thymus and the thyroid for growthand regeneration in the thymo-lymphaticsystem was studied.  the main results areas follows.  there is a considerable venousoutput of lymphocytes with low mito-chondrial content (small lymphocytes) fromthe thymus in normal young guinea-pigs.this explains the much higher incidence ofsmall lymphocytes in blood than in tho-racic-duct lymph.
