A simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed line of human parapharyngeal cells (SV-TGo) was cultured in semisolid agar to determine its ability to grow in the absence of an anchoring substratum and to evaluate any phenotypic changes that might have resulted during the isolation of sublines specifically selected for anchorage independence. After 2--3 weeks and 14--15 population doublings in culture, SV-TGo plated with over 1,000% higher efficiency than negative controls (F2408 cells). Sublines, 0.3--2.0 mm in diameter, were isolated and transferred to Leighton tubes in which they underwent an additional 0--7 divisions before senescence after 39--44 total population doublings.Â
