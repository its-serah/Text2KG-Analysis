Tests used to diagnose diabetes insipidus include:


Water deprivation test. For this test, you stop drinking fluids for several hours. During the test, your health care provider measures changes in your body weight, how much urine your body makes, and the concentration of your urine and blood. Your health care provider also may measure the amount of ADH in your blood.
 
During this test, you may receive a manufactured form of ADH. That can help show if your body is making enough ADH and if your kidneys can respond as expected to ADH.

Urine test. Testing urine to see if it contains too much water can be helpful in identifying diabetes insipidus.
Blood tests. Checking the levels of certain substances in the blood, such as sodium, potassium and calcium, can help with a diagnosis and may be useful in identifying the type of diabetes insipidus.
