The histological hallmark of GCA is a mononuclear cell infiltrate dominated by T lymphocytes and macrophages. The inflammatory infiltrate penetrates all layers of the arterial wall (Figure 21A-1). The infiltrates can be granulomatous with the accumulation of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells. Granuloma formation is most likely to be observed in the media. Although the presence of multinucleated giant cells inspired the name of the disease, they are often absent, and the mononuclear infiltrates lack a complex organization. If present, giant cells lie in close proximity to the fragmented internal elastic lamina. Their presence correlates with increased risk for ischemic complications. GCA can also present with perivascular cuffing of vasa vasorum or T cell–macrophage infiltrates in the adventitia, sometimes arranged along the external elastic lamina. This finding is consistent with recent studies suggesting that the adventitia is a critical site in the disease process.
