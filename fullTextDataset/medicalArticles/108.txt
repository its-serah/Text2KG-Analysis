2354. isoantigenic properties of tumors transgressing histocompatibilitybarriers of the h-2 systemsublines capable of transgressing h-2 histocompatibilitybarriers have been derivedfrom strictly strain-specific tumors by 1) passagethrough newborn hosts of aforeign genotype; 2) passage through adult h-2incompatible recipients pretreatedwith isoantisera directed against the tumor cells.the nonspecific character inducedby these procedures was usually expressed in anumber of different h-2 incompa-tible recipients.  the changes responsible forthe conversion to nonspecific growthappeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion.expression of the nonspecific characterrequired exposure to the foreign host environmentfor more than 30 days.  at thisstage and during the subsequent 3 transfergenerations, reversion to strain-specificgrowth occurred on back-transfer to thestrain of origin;
