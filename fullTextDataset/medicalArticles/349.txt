195. properties of a cold-precipitable protein fraction in thelensa soluble protein fraction which precipitatesin aqueous solutions at temperaturesbelow 10  c has been isolated from the ratlens.  this fraction appears to be re-sponsible for the reversible 'cold cataract'which has been seen to develop whenyoung mammals are exposed to temperaturesbelow 10  c.  as the rat ages, theconcentration of this protein fractiondecreases, but the fraction does not com-pletely disappear, even from the lensesof 3-year-old rats.
