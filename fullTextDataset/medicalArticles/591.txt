the determinants of cerebrospinal fluid po2 the effects of oxygen and   carbon dioxide breathing in patients with chronic lung disease .          the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 of some hypoxemic hypercapnic      patients with chronic lung disease is the same as that of patients      without chronic lung disease . breathing 95 oxygen with 5 carbon dioxideincreased lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 more than breathing 95 oxygen  with 5 nitrogen . the change in cerebrospinal fluid po2 is closely      related to the change in arterial pco2, and this relationship is similarto the relationship between arterial pco2 and cerebral blood flow in    patients with and without hypercapnia . interpretation of these         observations must be qualified by the following..
