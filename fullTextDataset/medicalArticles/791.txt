2564. chemical inactivation and reactivation of transforming dna (russian)the kinetics of the inactivation of linkedand unlinked genetic markers by meansof hno2 or uv light was studied.  closelylinked markers are inactivated simul-taneously, unlinked markers are inactivatedindependently.  it seems that thechemical attack on dna impairs a large partof macromolecule, including manycistrons.  it was shown by genetic experimentsthat chemical inactivation prac-tically does not influence the process of dnainclusion into competent cells.  bymeans of viscosity measurements it wasshown that the molecular weight andmacromolecular properties of dna do notsignificantly change during chemicalinactivation by means of hno2.  two explanationsfor the inactivation of trans-forming activity of dna are discussed  (1) structuraldeteriorations, preventing
