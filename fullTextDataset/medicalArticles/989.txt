In reviewing the literature and papers, there is insufficient information on the levels ofnickel release from different grades of stainless steels used in piercing to undertake acomplete risk assessment. There have been a limited number of studies on thepotential for stainless steel to cause primary sensitisation, but only estimates could bemade on the level of nickel release that would cause nickel sensitisation. In manycases, these studies have been incomplete in evaluating the extent of existingsensitisation or have an insufficiently large sample population to confidentlyextrapolate findings into the general population.Â
