effects of parathyroid hormone and other proteins in vitroon mitochondrial metabolismit is apparent that in addition to parathyroid hormone, severalnon-hormonal basic proteins stimulate mitochondrial respiration, iontransport, and atpase, but inhibit the 32pi-atp exchange reaction.thus these effects may not be so uniquely a measure of the biologicalactions of parathyroid hormone as the previous reports suggested.rasmussen et al. (1964) have also isolated from parathyroidextracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrialtransport of phosphate in vitro.  they postulated that this proteinmight be yet another biologically important factor produced by para-thyroid glands.  the latter speculation may not be warranted in viewof the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria.
