studies on the kinetics of transplantation immunity .                     using the parameter of the number of tumor cells necessary to produce s.c. tumors in allogeneic animals at varying intervals after antigenic  stimulation, immunity was found to be in force as early as 2 days after primary antigenic stimulation . it reached a peak at 8-10 days and had  largely subsided by the end of a month . this method was also applied tothe quantitative study of the onset, degree, and duration of immunity   elicited by skin grafts . the results obtained with inocula of large    numbers of tumor cells (10 percent) were comparable to those obtained   with massive skin grafts .                                                the differences in the degree of antigenic stimulation resulting from different routes of inoculation were studied . it was found that the    intradermal (i.d.)
