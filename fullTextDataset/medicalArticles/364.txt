                                           in patent ductus arteriosus, when the cardiac catheter is withdrawn   slowly from the aorta into the pulmonary artery, the outstanding        pressure curve is recorded in ductus arteriosus . the systolic pressure curve in the ductus arteriosus is the same as the systolic pressure in  the aorta and the diastolic pressure curve in the ductus arteriosus has a diastolic dip followed by a late diastolic pressure peak .              in patent ductus arteriosus, when the cardiac catheter is withdrawn   from the left pulmonary artery to the right ventricle, the pressure     curve reveals a considerable characteristic rise in pulmonary arterial  pressure which is regarded as an effect of the transmission of systemic pressure through the ductus arteriosus .
