visual neglect .                                                          clinical trainees in nursing and in psychology from boston college andsimmons college, boston, mass., collected data and observed patients    under the direction of the authors in a pilot program designed to       measure visual spatial neglect and to develop rehabilitative material . these measurements and exercises might also be used by nurses in their  care of those patients who have had cerebral vascular accidents .         the diversity of daily activities in which the patient becomes        involved during his hospitalization should provide some indication of   the extent to which the compensatory visual neglect therapeutics have   been effective . more formal estimates can be obtained by               re-administering the battery of visual neglect tests at periodic        intervals .
