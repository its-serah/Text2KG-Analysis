acquisition of languagealthough the work of bullowa, jones, and bever has some of its greatestpromise in the light it may shed on the development of functions of languagein children, the promise cannot be realized unless the authors givea great deal of explicit attention to the framework of such analysis, for thereis not, as may be the case for phonological and grammatical development,anything like a satisfactory body of linguistic theory and method as to theterminal state. Â while a good deal may be learned without such a theory, andnecessarily must be so learned, since the work in progress cannot be suspendeduntil such an unpredictable millenium, it still would be a pity if thechance were lost for the interaction of the acquisition of data and theimprovement of theoretical notions.
