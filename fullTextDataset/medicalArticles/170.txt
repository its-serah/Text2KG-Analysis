1846. anaphylactic tests in model tumour antigen investigationsthe efficacy of anaphylactic tests in detecting'tumor' antigen in serum was investi-gated.  a simple model of a tumor-antigenstudy was carried out using rat tissueand rat serum, with bovine y-globulin (byg)acting as a mock cancer antigen.  itwas found that if byg (absolute dosage 100ug.) had formed 1/6 of the antigen mix-ture used for sensitization it was readilydetected when present in a concentrationof 10-3 in the serum used for challenge,but not invariably detected in a concentra-tion of 10-4.
