2774. pitfalls in the clinical and histologic diagnosis of broncho-genic carcinomaa necropsy study of 380 cases of extrathoraciccarcinoma revealed that pulmonarymetastases occurred in almost 50% of thecases and bronchial metastases in over25%.  there were 39 cases (10.3%) in theseries with clinical features simulatingbronchogenic carcinoma and in 24 (62%)of these cases there was cytologic and/orhistologic confirmation.  carcinomas ofthe pancreas presented the greatest sourceof diagnostic error accounting for morethan one-third of the 39 cases; the primarysite second in frequency was carcinomaof the kidney.  bronchial metastases werechiefly responsible for the clinical,cytologic, and histologic findings compatiblewith the diagnosis of bronchogeniccarcinoma.
