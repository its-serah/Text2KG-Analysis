cell proliferationin experimental hydronephrosisand compensatory renal hyperplasiamitosis counts and autoradiographic counts of nuclei labeled withtritiated thymidine were made in the renal cortex of male rats in whichthe left ureter was ligated.  these were compared with correspondingcounts in the remaining kidney after left nephrectomy, and in sham-operated controls 24, 48 and 72 hours after operation.  the cortex ofthe kidney on the obstructed side showed a greater number of tritium-labeled nuclei and mitotic figures than in the kidney undergoing com-pensatory hyperplasia.  epithelial and interstitial cells responded simul-taneously on the obstructed side, whereas in the remaining kidney afternephrectomy, the epithelial response preceded a slight interstitial re-sponse by 48 hours.
