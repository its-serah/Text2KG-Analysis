Selenoenzymes contain the rare and unusual 21st amino acid selenocysteine (Sec, U)1 in their active sites and most of these enzymes characterized to date are oxidoreductases (1, 2). Examples of these selenoenzymes are glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1), iodothyronine deiodinase, and thioredoxin reductase (TR). Each of these examples either involve a substrate that is a potent oxidant (hydrogen peroxide/GPx-1), found in an organ whose tissues proliferate due to oxidative stress (thyroid/deiodinase), or is part of an anti-oxidant system responsible for keeping intracellular protein targets reduced (TR as part of the thioredoxin system) (3-5). A logical hypothesis is that these enzymes evolved to resist inactivation by oxidation (6, 7). This report explores this hypothesis using TR as a test case.
