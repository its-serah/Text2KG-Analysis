the inhibition of respiration and phosphorylation in kidneymitochondria by parathyroid hormone administered in vivo.   parathyroid hormone administeredin vivo to rabbitsproduced a metabolic alterationin kidney cortexmitochondria, evidenced bydiminished respiratory rate,respiratory control, and p:oratio with a series of substratesincluding pyruvate plusfumarate, succinate,ketoglutarate, malate, citrate,and isocitrate.  the adenosinetriphosphate-inorganicphosphate exchange reactionrate was decreased andadenosine triphosphataseactivity was increased comparedto control mitochondria.these changes did not becomeapparent until about 12 hr.after injection, were undiminishedby 24 hr., and couldbe elicited with as little as 200usp units of hormone.
