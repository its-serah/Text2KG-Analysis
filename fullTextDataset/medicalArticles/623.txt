induced tumour resistance in rats .                                       the human sarcoma hs has been grown in weanling rats treated with     cortisone . this growth was modified by prior injection of various      tissue antigens . active /immunity/ was produced by using human placentaor embryonic tissue as antigen, and similar results were obtained using suspensions of rapidly growing human tumours .                            the response to other human tissues varied.. foetal muscle and spleen were active, whereas adult plasma was inactive except from some patientswith extensive malignant disease .                                        passive protection was produced by using certain human sera at the    time of challenging with hs . sera from five women who aborted showed   this characteristic . where the pregnancy continued to term,            antisubstances were not found,. and they were present in the puerperium in only two out of fifty cases .
