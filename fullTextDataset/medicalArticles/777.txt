The behavior of lens epithelial cells from six-day chick embryos was studied in three different experimental situations: (a) explantation into several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed by reimplanlation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantation followed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity. Specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lens material of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serial sections. The results were interpreted as follows:
The internal architecture of the developing lens is not the only determinant of its overall shape.
The initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficient for their complete autonomous maturation.
