effect of testosterone propionate and growth hormone ongrowth and chemical composition of muscle and othertissues in hypophysectomized male ratsthe effect of testosteronepropionate and growth hormone on thegrowth of muscle, bone, pelt, viscera andseminal vesicles was studied in hypophysectomizedmale rats.  testosterone (0.1 mg/day)stimulated growth in the levator ani muscleand seminal vesicles but had no effect on theother tissues studied.  growth hormone (0.1mg/day) accelerated growth in all tissuesexcept the seminal vesicles.  testosterone didnot enhance the growth-promoting effect ofgrowth hormone in any tissue except thelevator ani muscle.
