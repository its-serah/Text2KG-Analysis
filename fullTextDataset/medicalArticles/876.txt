    measurements of nickel in biological materials by atomic absorption     spectrometry .                                                            an atomic absorption procedure has been developed which facilitates   quantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, including  urine, ribonucleic acids (rna), and serum proteins .                      the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorption       spectrometer (0.10 p.p.m.) was insufficient to permit direct            measurements of nickel in normal urine . therefore, it was necessary to employ a dimethylglyoxime extraction procedure to concentrate the       nickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry .                         the coefficients of variation of measurements of nickel in urine and  human b- globulins were 6.3 and 5.9 per cent, respectively . the        recovery of nickel added to urine averaged 96 per cent, with a range    from 94 to 97.
