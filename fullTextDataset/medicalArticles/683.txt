plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and 17-oxosteroids in patients with    breast cancer and in normal women .                                       (1) 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-ohcs) and 17-oxosteroids were       measured in the plasma of normal women, patients with early breast      cancer and in patients with advanced metastatic disease .                 (2) the mean plasma 17-ohcs level was found to be normal in the early stages of the disease but was raised in the advanced disease . in both  groups of patients the variance was significantly greater than in normalwomen .                                                                   (3) the mean plasma 17-oxosteroid level in both early and advanced    breast cancer was not significantly different from the normal level but the variance was increased .
