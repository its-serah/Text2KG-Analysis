1642. electrode catheters and the diagnosis of ebstein's anomalyof the tricuspid valvethe successful surgical treatment of ebstein'sanomaly calls for accurate pre-ope-rative assessment of the nature and severity ofthe tricuspid valvular lesion.  theincreased risk of cardiac catheterization in thiscondition has been matched by in-creased experience of intracardiac techniques,and provided the examination is inskilled hands, patients with ebstein's anomalyshould be investigated in the sameway as those with any other serious congenitalheart lesion for whom surgery is con-templated.  the diagnostic value of electrodecatheters is discussed, and the intra-cardiac electrocardiographic features of ebstein'sanomaly are illustrated.
