1751. on the subunits of a-crystallina-crystallin was isolated from totalwater-soluble lens extract by preparative zoneelectrophoresis on starch or pevikonc870 blocks and purified by density gradientcentrifugation and sephadex chromatography.these preparations were treated withurea or sodium dodecyl sulphate andsubmitted to electrophoresis on polyacrylamidegels containing either urea or sodiumdodecyl sulphate.  whereas in 7 m urea a largenumber of zones was detected, onlythree bands were observed in 1% sodium dodecylsulphate.  on the other hand, thesedimentation coefficient had the same value in bothmedia.
