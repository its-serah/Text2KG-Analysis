Published observations regarding chromosome changes induced by mycoplasma infection in mammalian cells were summarized. They are based on a limited number of mycoplasma strains and five types of cells, all human: one heteroploid cell line (FL): three types of diploid cells: and SV40 transformed amnion cells. Changes observed in FL cells after infection with Mycoplasma fermentans included reduction in chromosome number, increase in chromosome aberrations, and the appearance of new chromosome varieties. A new large telocentric chromosome eventually appeared in nearly all cells and persisted after mycoplasma elimination. There was no reversion to higher chromosome numbers after mycoplasma elimination, but many aberrations decreased in frequency. Various mechanisms proposed for mycoplasma induced chromosome changes are discussed and existing evidence evaluated. Data from two systems provide strong support for a direct, perhaps intracellular mycoplasma action as the cause of a genetic cell change.Â
