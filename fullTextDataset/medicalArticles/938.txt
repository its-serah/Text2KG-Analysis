it follows that inappropriate mothering (quantitatively
as well as qualitatively) results in what is referred to at
this time as the "derailment" of the primal dialogue.
controlled experiments with animals, findings of experimental
psychology, and, lastly, clinical findings illustrate the
mechanics of the derailed dialogue and its sequelae.
in the cases under review a surfeit of stimulation, a psychic
overloading, resulted in the derailment of dialogue.  overloading
prevents its subject from completing actions or responses initiated
by him.  long-lasting overload results in the cumulation of "incompleted
action cycles".  the sequelae of this cumulation are
profound changes in the behavior of the individual.  these changes
are manifested in a departure from the norms of individual and
social behavior patterns that are maladaptive for the individual
and asyntonic with his society, that is, asocial.
