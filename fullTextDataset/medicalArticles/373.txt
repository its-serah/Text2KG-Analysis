radioautographic studies of bone marrow lymphocytes in vivo and in      diffusion chamber cultures .                                              radioautography with tritiated thymidine has been utilized to examine the turnover rate and origin of small lymphocytes in the bone marrow of the guinea-pig .                                                          very few marrow lymphocytes were initially labeled by a single        injection of tritiated thymidine, but thereafter the number of labeled  lym phocytes rapidly increased to high maximum levels at 3 days .       analysis of the labeling curves and grain counts indicates that the     population of marrow lymphocytes is maintained in a dynamic steady statewith an average turnover time of 3 days or less .                         suspensions of bone marrow cells were isolated from the circulation   within intraperitoneal diffusion chambers after short-term labeling withtritiated thymidine in vivo . although very few small lymphocytes were  labeled when introduced into the diffusion chambers, a considerable     percentage became labeled during the subsequent culture period .
