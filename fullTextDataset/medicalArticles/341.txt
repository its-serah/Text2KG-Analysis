characterization of bacillus subtilis bacteriophages .                    brodetsky, anna m. (university of california, los angeles), and w. r. romig . characterization of bacillus subtilis bacteriophages . j.       bacteriol. 90..1655-1663. 1965.--a group of six phages, sp5, sp6, sp7,  sp8, sp9, and sp13, which use the marburg strain of bacillus subtilis ashost was characterized . these phages, referred to as group 1, were     examined for the following properties.. host range, plaque morphology,  stability, adsorption kinetics, one-step growth characteristics, calciumrequirements, serum neutralization, thermal inactivation, and           inactivation by ultraviolet irradiation . five unrelated b. subtilis    phages, sp3, sp10, pbs1, sp alpha, and sp beta, were included in the    studies . when first isolated, none of the group 1 phages was able to   replicate efficiently on b. subtilis sb19, a mutant of the /transforming/ b. subtilis 168 .
