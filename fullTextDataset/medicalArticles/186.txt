release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue obtained from newborn   infants .                                                                 summary the role played by mobilization of free fatty acids (ffa) fromadipose tissue in producing the typically high serum ffa levels of humaninfants has been studied . ffa concentrations in the serum and subcuta- neous adipose tissue from the gluteal region were determined during     postnatal development . a maximum level was reached within 24 hr after  birth, after which there was a gradual fall . in serum the ffa level at the end of 12 months was still higher than that in adults, while the ffalevel in adipose tissue was lower at 3 months than in adults .            incubation of small pieces of adipose tissue in krebs-ringer phosphatebuffer containing 4 albumin led to release of ffa into the medium .
