heparin levels during and after hypothermic perfusion .                   1. perfusion-temperature influences the rate of heparin-loss during   extracorporeal circulation, and therefore, the requirement of           re-heparinization .                                                       2. heparin half-lives of approximately 13/4 hours and 21/2 hours were calculated during perfusions conducted at average temperatures of 31.5  and 22.6 c. respectively .                                                3. the rate of heparin-loss during extracorporeal circulation is      inconstant in an individual, and variable between individuals, so that  exact neutralization requires an accurate estimation of the heparin     concentration present at the end of perfusion .
