Laboratory investigations were unremarkable apart from an elevated ESR at 72 mm/h. Skin biopsy demonstrated acute and chronic arteritis involving medium-sized vessels in the dermis, consistent with CPAN. An ankle X-ray showed periosteal elevation and new bone formation affecting the tibia. MRI scan showed bilateral ankle effusions, marked tenosynovitis, disruption of the articular surfaces of both subtalar joints and a lesion in the metaphysis of the right tibia, thought to represent a medullary bone infarct possibly secondary to arteritis (Fig. 1). A synovial biopsy of the right ankle demonstrated extensive perivascular chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate with several foci of acute inflammation. There was a good initial response to prednisolone 30 mg daily, but a poor response to colchicine, hydroxychloroquine and dapsone.
