  further groups of rats were given rat embryonic tissues as antigen,   and the tumour challenge was then made with walker tumour,. the results were variable .                                                           with a benzpyrene-induced tumour in a pure line of /wag/ rat the      effect was not obtained except in isolated cases .                        in experiments in mice, using as challenge an irondextran induced     mouse sarcoma, prior injection with embryonic mouse liver or placenta   increased the resistance to the growth of the tumour, but the tumour hasnot as yet been produced in a pure-line mouse . on the other hand mouse experiments, using as challenge the crocker tumour, proved negative .     it is suggested that immune reactions may play a part in causing some abortions .
