the carrier state of bacillus subtilis infected with the transducing    bacteriophage sp10 .                                                      bacteriophage sp10 may infect bacillus subtilis to form a carrier     system . the infected bacteria give rise to infected organisms after sixor more successive single-colony isolations . about 60 of the spores    derived from such an infected culture yield clones that produce phage,  and such spores retain their ability to produce phage even after        treatment with antiserum and heating at 80 . four hours' incubation of  carrier spores in nutrient broth yields cultures having more than 10    infective centers per bacterium . cultivation of infected organisms in  medium containing sp10 antiserum leads to loss of phage and loss of     immunity to phage infection . dna with a density characteristic of viraldna can be detected in infected bacteria .
