studies of nickel carcinogenesis fractionations of nickel in            ultracentrifugal supernatants of lung and liver by means of dextran gel chromatography .                                                          chromatographic fractionations have been performed on the             ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung and liver by   the use of columns of dextran gel (sephadex g-100) . a major proportion of nickel in these tissue supernatants has been demonstrated to be      firmly bound to macromolecular constituents . following acute and       chronic inhalation of carcinogenic levels of nickel carbonyl, the       predominant increases in the concentrations of nickel have been observedin the macromolecular fractions .
