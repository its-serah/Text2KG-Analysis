Absence of the cystic duct can result from a congenital or an acquired process. In both cases, they are difficult to diagnose pre-operatively even though magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has shown great potential in delineating the EHBT. It confers an increased risk of injury to the surrounding biliary tract during cholecystectomy. Therefore, the surgical approach depends on the surgeon's operative competency and knowledge related to EHBT anomalies.Definitive treatment for patients with symptomatic absent cystic duct is an open cholecystectomy, given its increased likelihood of iatrogenic morbidity. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be performed if the surgeon carries sufficient skills.
