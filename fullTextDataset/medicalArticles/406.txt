3075. vaccinia pneumonia in mice.  a light and electron microscopic and viralassay studyswiss white mice between 2 and 4 days of agedeveloped generalized vaccinia viralinfection 2 to 7 days after intranasal inoculation.gross and histologic evidence ofpneumonia was seen in more than 80% ofapproximately 300 mice.  virus was re-covered in relatively high titers from thelungs (10   pfu per g) during the per-iod when pneumonia developed; viremiawas also present, but virus titers in theblood stream remained much below thosein the lungs.  histologically, vacciniapneumonia was characterized by large swollenmononuclear cells giving rise tomarked widening of alveolar septa.  onlyscattered neutrophils were noted.
