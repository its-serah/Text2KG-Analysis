investigations into the thiazide-induced antidiuresis inpatients with diabetes insipidusplasma sodium, osmolality and serumchloride, together with creatinine clear-ance, were studied before and duringthiazide treatment of 7 patients withdiabetes insipidus.the diuresis was reduced by 28-39%.the urine osmolality was increased by7-128%.  an average decrease in plasmasodium of 4 meq/i, in plasma osmolalityof 21 mosm/kg, and in serum chloride of8 meq/i was observed.  only in one pa-tient was the creatinine clearance re-duced significantly.  the thirst-feeling wasreduced even from the first day of treat-ment.  the diuresis was not minimal untilthe third to fourth day.  if the diuresis wascorrected for the extra electrolyte ex-cretion initiated by the thiazide, theantidiuresis was found to be operating tothe full extent even on the first day oftreatment.
