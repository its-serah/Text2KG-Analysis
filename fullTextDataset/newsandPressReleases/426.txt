disastrous flood in 2004 destroyed 95 percent of the Federal documents collection. The Library has successfully rebuilt the collection, largely with donations from other libraries, and it now contains about 80 percent of the pre-flood holdings. The Library is a preservation steward for United States Reports, with holdings that extend back to the 18th century.
