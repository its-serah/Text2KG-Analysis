the combined collections. Recognizing the need for preservation of the print collection, the group also is able to identify a single print copy of every Federal document in the UC libraries to be held as a permanent archival copy for the UC system. Geisel Library’s Government Information Librarians also participate in UC/Stanford Government Information Librarians (GILS). The goal of GILS is to improve University-wide collections and access to Government information in print and electronic formats and enable communication and sharing expertise among California’s Government Information Librarians.
