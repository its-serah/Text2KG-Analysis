part of the campaign, the library created a Government documents coloring book and bookmark and hosted anniversary-related events featuring various librarians and scholars as guest speakers. It produced seven new LibGuides on Government information and displayed six exhibits throughout the library that pointed users to the depository. For children, the library developed educational materials and engaged middle-school students with direct programming. “I congratulate the staff at the J.D. Williams Library for its innovative and steadfast efforts in Keeping America Informed on the three branches of the Federal Government since 1883,”
