the Legislative Branch Bulk Data Task Force, throughout FY 2018, GPO worked with the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate on initiatives to convert legacy file formats into United States Legislative Markup (USLM) XML. In early FY 2019, the first project was completed with the release of a subset of enrolled bills, public and private laws, and Statutes at Large in Beta USLM XML on govinfo. USLM offers a standard XML schema to promote interoperability among documents as they flow through the legislative and regulatory processes.
