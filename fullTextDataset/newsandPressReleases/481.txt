Law. WASHINGTON â€“The U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) has acquired six new ink jet presses as a part of its ongoing Plant Operations modernization efforts. The digital presses will streamline production and allow the agency to automate the work flow from the start of a project to final publication. Along with providing high-speed automated printing, these digital print machines also offer real-time data for operational accountability. These ink jet presses replace more than 30-year-old outdated equipment. The new presses are faster, more reliable, and more cost-efficient than the previous equipment.
