Journals of Government and Acting Chief Administrative Officer Lyle L. Green has retired after 30 years at the agency. Green started as a proofreader of Congressional documents and went on to being part of and eventually overseeing high profile jobs for Congress and the White House, including the President’s Federal Budget every year, the inaugural materials every four years, and all special programs for Congress. “I first got to know Lyle’s great work and commitment to Congress while I was working on Capitol Hill,” said GPO Director Hugh Nathanial Halpern.
