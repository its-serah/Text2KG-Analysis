Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2024. The Belarusian government targeted human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, opposition politicians, culture workers, trade unionists, activists, and other people perceived to disagree with the official agenda. In early November, at least 1,462 people were behind bars on politically motivated charges according to the leading Belarusian rights group Viasna. “Over the past year, Belarusian authorities doubled down to create an information vacuum around raging repressions by cutting political prisoners off from the outside world and bullying their lawyers and families into silence,”
