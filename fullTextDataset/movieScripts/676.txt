Jones, 40, goose-necked and gangly with thinning dark hair, HUNT-AND-PECKS at his ancient computer, surrounded by boxes of GARDENING MAGAZINES and empty coffee cups. Coraline, with doll, opens the SQUEAKY DOOR. He doesn't turn. CORALINE Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad?

CORALINE D'you know where the garden tools are? He hears rain outside. CHARLIE It's pouring out there, isn't it.
