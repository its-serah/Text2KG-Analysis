Will can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's boys from the hood of a car. Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a fighter. He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows. The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone throws a bottle. In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will .
