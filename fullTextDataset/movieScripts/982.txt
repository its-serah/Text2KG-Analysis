out here but us. Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight. COMBAT SHIP What are you doing out here? CRABBY What does it look like, genius? I'm crabbing! COMBAT SHIP Well turn around and go back where you came from. CRABBY Yeah? And who's gonna make me? A laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes. CRABBY Alright, alright! Don't get your prop in a twist. (as he turns to leave) What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
