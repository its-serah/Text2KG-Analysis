What, uh-- yes. George Banks here. Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency. I should like you to send a policeman around immediately. Mrs. Banks: The policeman's here, George! Mr. Banks: What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service. Thank you so much. Good night. Come in, constable. Come in. Constable: Thank you, sir. While going about my duties on the other side of the park, I noted some valuables that had gone astray. I believe they're yours, sir. Mr. Banks: Valuables? Constable: Come along, now.
