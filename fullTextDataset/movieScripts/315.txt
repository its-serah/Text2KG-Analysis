CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe out of the crater and onto the beach. Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane. COOPER Space probe. Never seen one like it, though. Looks like it's been to hell and back. The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back. RIGGS How do you think it wound up here? COOPER Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites would have been shot down by the Chinese twenty years ago.
