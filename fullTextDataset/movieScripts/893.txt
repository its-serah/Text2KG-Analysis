MCS -- Dorothy singing -- swings on wheel of rake -- then walks forward around wheel -- Toto jumps up onto seat of rake -- Dorothy pets him -- sits on front of rake -- CAMERA PULLS back -- Dorothy finishes song -- DOROTHY (CONT'D) (sings) ...Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops, Away above the chimney tops,
