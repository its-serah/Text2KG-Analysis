Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter finishing the day's work. Doyle turns around. The jungle is breaking apart and crawling down the beach towards them. DOYLE I think we've got a problem. Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed as they move towards them. Roth begins to step out towards them. 85. ROTH Fascinating. I think- Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the shelter after Doyle. Case pushes the door closed. INT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET --
