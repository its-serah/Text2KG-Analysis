OUT! The Commander runs to the ledge, the Goose right behind him. ZENG What's happening?! The Goose looks over the edge and sees Tai Lung at the bottom of the pit. Tai Lung struggles with his shackles. COMMANDER Fire Crossbows! Tai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls, creating a makeshift staircase. ZENG Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu! The Commander shuts the Goose up. COMMANDER You're not going anywhere. And neither is he.
