EVERY ONE OF EM'S BAD, EXCEPT YOU. (speaking) Oh, thanks, Buddy. (singing, as Kristoff) BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN REINDEERS. SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I'M RIGHT? (As Sven) THAT'S ONCE AGAIN TRUE, FOR ALL EXCEPT YOU. (As Kristoff) YOU GOT ME. LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT. (As Sven) GOOD NIGHT. (As Kristoff) DON'T LET THE FROSTBITE BITE. The door opens. Anna
