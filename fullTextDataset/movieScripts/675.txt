handed a NEWSPAPER-WRAPPED PACKAGE. Attached note reads: WYBIE (V.O.) Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's trunk. Look familiar? Wybie. She rips open the package and finds the BUTTON-EYED, BLUE- HAIRED, YELLOW RAINCOAT-WEARING DOLL from the head credits - it's a litte Coraline! CORALINE (to herself) Huh... a little me? That's weird. She crumples the note, both annoyed and charmed. MEL What's his name, anyway? CORALINE Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls. But Coraline takes it with her and leaves the room. INT.
