Looks like it's the end of the line. Buddy? ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone. CUT TO: FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine. We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn, the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK. 3. THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force
