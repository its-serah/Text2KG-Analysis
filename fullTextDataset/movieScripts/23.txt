You strike me as a particularly icy
  and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.
  It chills my blood just to look at
  you. By the power vested in me by
  the State of Maine, I hereby order
  you to serve two life sentences,
  back to back, one for each of your
  victims. So be it. I've learned
  my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a
  changed man. I'm no longer a danger
  to society. That's the God's honest
  truth. No doubt about it.
