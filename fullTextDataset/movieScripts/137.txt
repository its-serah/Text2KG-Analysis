AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK Wall-E travels alone. Traverses miles of desolate waste. Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather. Passes haunting structures buried within the trash. Buildings, highways, entire cities... Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO. "Buy N Large" "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation! The corporation ran every aspect of life. There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate. CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over. Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!" The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!" A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile.
