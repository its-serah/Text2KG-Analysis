in view. INT. TRUCK - SAME Wall-E alone in the center of his shelter. Unwraps a BNL SPONGECAKE (think Twinkie). Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in. It happily dives in. Wall-E collapses himself into a storable cube. Backs into an empty shelf space. Rocks it like a cradle... ...and shuts down for the night. Outside the wind howls like the Hounds of Hell. INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - NEXT MORNING Wall-E's CHARGE METER flashes "WARNING". He wakes. Unboxes. Groggy and lifeless. Stumbles outside. EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK
