WYBIE (under his breath, nervous) Grandma! He holds up his hands in surrender, nodding with eyes closed, forcing some laughs. WYBIE (CONT'D) Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch. He picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his gloved hands. WYBIE (CONT'D) But I'd wear gloves next time. CORALINE (SKEPTICAL) Why? He points to her dowsing rod, nods.
