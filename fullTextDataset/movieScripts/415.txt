hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked. DOYLE I've got a problem over here, too. Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material of the hull. Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him, bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass. DOYLE (CONT'D) It's not the hull... it's inside the ship... it's... ROTH (SMILES) It's beautiful.
