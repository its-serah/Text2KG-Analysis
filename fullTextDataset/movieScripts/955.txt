What is it, Katie Nanna? Katie Nanna: Mrs. Banks, I have something to say to you. Mrs. Banks: Where are the children? Katie Nanna: The children, madam, to be precise, are not here. They've disappeared again. Mrs. Banks: Katie Nanna, this is really too careless of you. Doesn't it make the third time this week? Katie Nanna: The fourth, madam. And I for one have had my fill of it. I'm not one to speak ill of the children, but-- Mrs. Banks: Oh, please, when do you expect them home?
