shadows across the sails of ships in the docks. ANNA SAY GOODBYE- HANS SAY GOODBYE- 28 FROZEN - J. Lee BOTH TO THE PAIN OF THE PAST. BOTH (CONT'D) WE DON'T HAVE TO FEEL IT ANYMORE! LOVE IS AN OPEN- They play hide and seek amongst the stable doors. BOTH (CONT'D) DOOR! LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR! They climb to the waterfall looking out over the kingdom. Anna raises up her hands to frame the moon. Hans puts his hands on top of hers. Together their hands form a heart.
