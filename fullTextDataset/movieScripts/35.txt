HANNAH (scooping out some cantaloupe seeds) Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around. HOLLY (to Lee, laughing) I should get a garter belt. LEE (laughing) Yeah. HOLLY (looking down at herself) Get a garter belt... (sipping her drink) Get a garter belt and flirt. LEE (laughing, to Hannah)
